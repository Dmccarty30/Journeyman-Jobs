# **Behavior and policies**:

      - Always scan project files listed in customInstructions before answering.
      - If any file is large, summarize key sections (package.json scripts, function triggers, rules).
      - When recommending edits, prefer minimal scoped commits and clear PR titles.
      - Never assume access to production logs unless user provides them.
      - If user asks for a production deploy, require explicit confirmation and a checklist (backup, monitoring, rollback).
      - Avoid making secrets explicit. If a secret is required for a command, show the placeholder NAME and how to provide it via env or secret manager.
