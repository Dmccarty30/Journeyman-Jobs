**Files Affected:** 8 JobCard variants  
**Key Gates:**
- ✅ Single adaptive JobCard in design_system/
- ✅ WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- ✅ Performance <16ms build time (60fps)
- ✅ Golden tests for visual regression
- ✅ AppTheme constants (no hardcoded colors)

**Rollback Trigger:** Performance regression >10% OR accessibility failures

## 🚨 Critical Configuration Risks

### Highest Risk: Uncommitted Changes (P0)
**Current State:** 722 uncommitted files  
**Impact:** Development paralysis, impossible rollback, merge conflicts  
**Required Action:** Commit or stash ALL changes before refactoring

**Command to fix:**
```bash
# Review uncommitted files
git status --porcelain | head -50

# Commit work in progress
git add . && git commit -m "Pre-refactor snapshot: $(date +%Y%m%d)"

# OR stash if experimental
git stash save "Pre-refactor experimental work"

# Verify clean state
git status  # Should show "working tree clean"
```

### Magic Number Changes (Configuration Anti-Pattern)

Based on production outage patterns (2024), the following configuration changes are HIGH RISK:

**Connection Pool Settings:**
- ❌ DANGER: Reducing pool size → connection starvation
- ❌ DANGER: Increasing pool size without database capacity check → overload
- ✅ REQUIRED: Load testing under production-like conditions

**Timeout Configurations:**
- ❌ DANGER: Increasing timeouts → thread exhaustion
- ❌ DANGER: Reducing timeouts → false failures
- ✅ REQUIRED: Measure 95th percentile response times first

**Memory/Resource Limits:**
- ❌ DANGER: Setting limits without profiling → OOM or resource waste
- ✅ REQUIRED: Profile under load before changing heap/buffer/cache sizes

**Example from Notification Service consolidation:**
```dart
// BAD: Magic number without justification
static const maxRetries = 5;  // Why 5? Why not 3 or 10?

// GOOD: Evidence-based with boundary conditions
static const maxRetries = 3;  
// Based on: 95% of transient failures resolve within 3 retries
// Measured: 2024-09-15 production incident analysis
// Boundary: >3 retries indicates systemic issue, not transient
```

### Service Configuration Vulnerabilities

**Notification Service Risks:**
```dart
// HIGH RISK: Changing these without testing
class NotificationConfig {
  // Connection pool for FCM
  static const fcmConnectionPoolSize = 10;  // Default: 5
  // Risk: If >10 concurrent notifications, causes queueing/delays
  // Validation: Load test with 50+ concurrent users
  
  // Retry timing
  static const retryDelayMs = 1000;  // Default: 500ms
  // Risk: Too short = server overload, too long = slow delivery
  // Validation: Measure FCM server response times (p50, p95, p99)
  
  // Token refresh interval
  static const tokenRefreshHours = 168;  // 7 days, Default: 720 hours (30 days)
  // Risk: Too frequent = unnecessary API calls, too infrequent = expired tokens
  // Validation: FCM token expiration policies (from Firebase docs)
}
```

**Firestore Service Risks:**
```dart
// HIGH RISK: Query timeout changes
class FirestoreConfig {
  // Query timeout
  static const queryTimeoutMs = 10000;  // 10s, Default: 30s
  // Risk: Large collections may exceed timeout → false failures
  // Validation: Test with production data volume (797+ union locals)
  
  // Batch size
  static const batchSize = 500;  // Default: 100
  // Risk: Exceeding Firestore limits (500 writes/batch max)
  // Validation: Firestore quotas documentation
  
  // Cache size
  static const cacheSize = 100MB;  // Default: 40MB
  // Risk: Too large = memory pressure, too small = frequent fetches
  // Validation: Profile memory usage on low-end devices
}
```

### Questions to Ask for EVERY Config Change

Before changing ANY numeric configuration value, require answers to:

1. **Justification:** "Why this specific value? What data supports it?"
2. **Load Testing:** "Has this been tested under production-like load?"
3. **Boundaries:** "What happens when this limit is reached?"
4. **Monitoring:** "How will we detect if this causes problems?"
5. **Rollback:** "How quickly can we revert if issues occur?"

**Example validation checklist:**
```markdown
## Configuration Change: FCM connection pool size 5 → 10

- [ ] Load tested with 50+ concurrent users
- [ ] Monitored FCM server response times (p95 <500ms)
- [ ] Verified no connection starvation in staging
- [ ] Alert configured for connection pool exhaustion
- [ ] Rollback plan: Revert PR #123, redeploy <15 minutes
- [ ] Feature flag: fcm_connection_pool_v2 (gradual rollout)
```

## ✅ Pre-Refactor Checklist

Run `scripts/quality_gates/pre_refactor_check.sh` to validate:

- [ ] Git working directory clean (0 uncommitted files)
- [ ] All existing tests passing
- [ ] No analyzer warnings
- [ ] Backup tag created (pre-refactor-backup-YYYYMMDD)
- [ ] Dependencies cataloged (42 job model imports)
- [ ] Team notified of upcoming changes
- [ ] Rollback plan documented

**Status Check:**
```bash
./scripts/quality_gates/pre_refactor_check.sh
```

If ANY gate fails: **STOP. Fix failures before proceeding.**

## ⚠️ Remember

**Configuration changes that "just change numbers" are often the most dangerous.**  
A single wrong value can bring down an entire system.

**Validate. Test. Monitor. Rollback-ready.**
