# Product Guidelines - Journeyman Jobs

## Visual Identity
- **High-Contrast Interface:** The UI must use a bold, high-contrast color palette (Copper, Navy, and high-visibility Yellow/Amber) to ensure maximum readability in outdoor and field conditions.
- **Electrical Heritage:** Incorporate subtle electrical motifs (circuit patterns, lightning bolts) without compromising the "Urgent & Direct" functional goal.
- **At-a-Glance Status:** Use color-coding for job urgency (e.g., Red for immediate storm response, Blue for standard calls).

## Communication & Tone
- **Urgent & Direct:** All copy should be concise and action-oriented. Avoid flowery language; focus on the data points electrical workers need to make quick decisions.
- **Informational Hierarchy:** Critical data points (Show-up Time, Wage, Utility) must be prominently displayed and formatted for instant scanning.

## Content Guidelines
- **Storm Call Structure:** Every storm work posting must be broken down into scannable fields:
    - **Show-up Date/Time:** Exact logistics for mobilization.
    - **Local Conditions:** Clear summary of the specific local union storm contract (Hours, Wages, Special Conditions).
    - **Affected Utility:** The specific utility company the work is being performed for.
    - **Incentives:** Prominent display of travel reimbursements and completion bonuses.
- **No-Nonsense Navigation:** Ensure the path from notification to the referral process is as short and friction-less as possible.

## User Experience Principles
- **Field-Ready:** UI elements must be large enough for "fat-finger" interaction and readable in bright sunlight or low-light storm conditions.
- **Offline Resilience:** Since storm work often involves damaged infrastructure, the app should provide offline access to previously synced job details and essential union contact info.
