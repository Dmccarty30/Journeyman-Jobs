# Scraper Corrections Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Job ID Generation Logic

- Modified `generateJobId` function in `jobCrud.js` to include employer in the ID format
- This ensures unique document IDs and better organization in Firestore

### 2. Added Table Boundary Validation

- Added `isInTable` function to `jobCrud.js` to validate job entries
- Implemented filtering in Local 77 and Local 602 scrapers
- This prevents invalid or generated entries from being added to the database

### 3. Added Missing Local 77 Job

- Added the missing ASPLUNDH TREE EXPERT job to the Local 77 scraper
- This ensures complete job data for Local 77

### 4. Created Migration Script

- Created `migration_script.js` to handle database migrations:
  - Removes invalid Local 125 document (125-line_clearance_tree_trimming-STORM_CALLS)
  - Corrects Local 602 document IDs to include employer

### 5. Added Validation Tests

- Created `validation_tests.js` to verify corrections:
  - Tests document IDs contain employer
  - Tests table boundary validation works correctly
  - Tests Local 125 invalid document is removed
  - Tests Local 77 missing job is added

## Running the Migration Script

To apply the database corrections:

```bash
node v3/completed/migration_script.js
```

This will:

1. Remove the invalid Local 125 document
2. Correct all Local 602 document IDs to include employer

## Running the Validation Tests

To verify all corrections have been properly applied:

```bash
node v3/completed/validation_tests.js
```

This will run all tests and report any failures.

## Notes on Local 226

The Local 226 scraper uses OpenAI for extraction rather than direct HTML parsing, so the field mapping correction mentioned in the original plan was not applicable. The scraper extracts job data using LLM processing of the HTML content rather than using specific CSS selectors.

## Verification Process

After running the migration script and validation tests, you should:

1. Check Firestore console for:
   - Removed Local 125 document
   - Corrected Local 602 doc IDs
   - New Local 77 job entry
2. Run scrapers in dry-run mode to verify they correctly filter invalid jobs
3. Validate counts before/after operations match expectations
