# Wave 2: Navigation Guards - Quick Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## What Was Done

### Files Modified
1. **lib/navigation/app_router.dart** - Enhanced redirect logic with Riverpod integration
2. **lib/screens/onboarding/auth_screen.dart** - Added redirect parameter handling

### Key Changes

#### Router Changes
- ✅ Replaced `FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser` with Riverpod providers
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive redirect logic with query parameters
- ✅ Added security validation for redirect paths
- ✅ Defined public routes: `/`, `/welcome`, `/auth`, `/forgot-password`, `/onboarding`
- ✅ All other routes now require authentication

#### Auth Screen Changes
- ✅ Added `_getRedirectDestination()` to extract redirect query param
- ✅ Added `_navigateAfterAuth()` to navigate with redirect support
- ✅ Updated sign-in success to use redirect helpers

## How It Works

### User Flow
```
Unauthenticated user → /locals
    ↓
Redirect to → /auth?redirect=%2Flocals
    ↓
User signs in
    ↓
Navigate to → /locals (original destination)
```

### Code Example
```dart
// Router redirect logic
if (requiresAuth && !isAuthenticated) {
  return '$auth?redirect=${Uri.encodeComponent(currentPath)}';
}

// Auth screen post-login navigation
void _navigateAfterAuth() {
  final redirect = _getRedirectDestination();
  context.go(redirect ?? AppRouter.home);
}
```

## Security Features

✅ **Open Redirect Prevention**
- Validates redirect paths must start with `/`
- Blocks protocol-relative URLs (`//evil.com`)
- Blocks absolute URLs (`https://evil.com`)
- Blocks JavaScript protocols (`javascript:alert(1)`)

## Integration with Wave 1

Uses two providers from Wave 1:
1. `authInitializationProvider` - Checks if Firebase Auth is ready
2. `authStateProvider` - Provides current user state

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Fresh app start redirects correctly
- [ ] Unauthenticated access to `/locals` → redirects to `/auth?redirect=%2Flocals`
- [ ] Authenticated user on `/auth` → redirects to `/home`
- [ ] Login with redirect param → navigates to original destination
- [ ] Invalid redirect → fallback to `/home`
- [ ] Public routes always accessible

## Next: Wave 3

Add skeleton loading screens while auth initializes

## Files Changed

**lib/navigation/app_router.dart**
- Lines 1-7: Imports
- Lines 259-362: Redirect logic and security validation

**lib/screens/onboarding/auth_screen.dart**
- Lines 93-128: Redirect helper methods
- Line 226: Updated navigation call

## Quick Reference

**Public Routes**: `/`, `/welcome`, `/auth`, `/forgot-password`, `/onboarding`
**Protected Routes**: Everything else

**Redirect Parameter**: `?redirect=/locals`
**Redirect Validation**: `_isValidRedirectPath()`
