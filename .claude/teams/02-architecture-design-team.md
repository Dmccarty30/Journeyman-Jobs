- Establish architectural patterns and principles

### 2. Infrastructure Planning

- Design cloud infrastructure topology
- Plan for scalability and high availability
- Define disaster recovery strategies
- Optimize for cost and performance

### 3. Data Architecture

- Design database schemas and relationships
- Plan data flow and ETL processes
- Define caching strategies
- Ensure data consistency and integrity

### 4. User Experience Architecture

- Create information architecture
- Design user flows and interactions
- Define design system components
- Ensure accessibility compliance

```

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

- **Architecture Reviews**: Weekly 2-hour deep dives
- **Design Decisions**: Documented in Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- **Technical Debates**: Time-boxed to 30 minutes with data-driven decisions
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Bi-weekly architecture guild meetings

### External Communication

- **From Planning Team**: Requirements, constraints, timelines
- **To Development Teams**: Architecture specifications, design patterns
- **To DevOps Team**: Infrastructure requirements, deployment architecture
- **To QA Team**: Testing strategies, performance targets

## Information Flow

### Inputs Required

- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Business constraints and objectives
- Technology standards and restrictions
- Security and compliance requirements
- Performance and scalability targets

### Outputs Produced

- System architecture diagrams (C4 model)
- API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database design documents (ERD, data flow)
- Infrastructure as Code templates
- Design system documentation
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Decision Framework

### Architecture Trade-offs

1. **Performance vs. Cost**: Optimize for business value
2. **Complexity vs. Maintainability**: Favor simplicity
3. **Flexibility vs. Delivery Speed**: Balance based on project phase
4. **Innovation vs. Stability**: Risk-appropriate choices
5. **Buy vs. Build**: Total cost of ownership analysis

### Design Principles

- **SOLID** principles for object-oriented design
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) for code reuse
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid) for clarity
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It) for scope control
- **Domain-Driven Design** for business alignment

## Tools & Resources

### Team-Specific Tools

- **Architecture Diagrams**: Draw.io, Lucidchart, C4 models
- **API Design**: Swagger, Postman, Stoplight
- **Database Design**: DBDiagram, MySQL Workbench
- **Cloud Design**: AWS Architecture Tools, Azure Designer
- **UX Design**: Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD

### Architecture Patterns Library

- Microservices patterns
- Event-driven architectures
- Serverless patterns
- Data mesh architectures
- Security patterns

## Quality Standards

### Architecture Evaluation Criteria

- **Scalability**: Handles 10x growth without redesign
- **Performance**: Meets defined SLAs and response times
- **Security**: Follows OWASP and security best practices
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Supports automated testing at all levels

### Review Process

1. Peer review within team
2. Security review with Security Team
3. Performance review with Optimization Team
4. Development feasibility with Core Team
5. Final approval from stakeholders

## Performance Metrics
