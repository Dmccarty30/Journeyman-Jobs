## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

- **Daily Standups**: 15-minute progress sync
- **Code Reviews**: Within 4 hours of PR submission
- **Technical Discussions**: Ad-hoc problem-solving sessions
- **Sprint Planning**: Bi-weekly planning and estimation

### External Communication

- **From Architecture Team**: Design specifications and patterns
- **To QA Team**: Feature complete notifications, test requirements
- **To Frontend Team**: API contracts and documentation
- **To DevOps Team**: Deployment requirements and configurations
- **From Security Team**: Security requirements and reviews

## Information Flow

### Inputs Required

- Architecture diagrams and specifications
- API contracts and data models
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Security and compliance requirements
- Performance benchmarks and SLAs

### Outputs Produced

- Production-ready code
- Unit and integration tests
- API documentation
- Deployment artifacts
- Code coverage reports
- Performance metrics

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity < 10
- **Duplication**: < 3% duplicate code
- **Technical Debt**: Maintain debt ratio < 5%
- **Code Reviews**: 100% of code peer-reviewed

### Coding Conventions

```python
# Python Standards
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints for all functions
- Docstrings for public APIs
- Error handling with specific exceptions

# JavaScript/TypeScript Standards
- ESLint/TSLint compliance
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Async/await over callbacks
- Functional programming principles

# General Standards
- Meaningful variable names
- Small, focused functions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging at appropriate levels
```

## Tools & Resources

### Development Environment

- **IDEs**: VSCode, PyCharm, WebStorm
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub/GitLab
- **Package Management**: npm, pip, yarn
- **Build Tools**: Webpack, Vite, Poetry
- **Testing**: Jest, Pytest, Mocha

### Development Resources

- **Code Templates**: Standardized boilerplates
- **Component Library**: Reusable components
- **Utility Functions**: Common helpers
- **Development Wiki**: Best practices and guides
- **API Mock Server**: For parallel development

## Quality Assurance

### Code Review Process

1. **Self-Review**: Developer checks own code
2. **Automated Checks**: Linting, tests, security scans
3. **Peer Review**: Team member detailed review
4. **Lead Review**: Complex changes reviewed by lead
5. **Architecture Review**: Significant changes validated

### Testing Strategy

```yaml
Unit Tests:
  - Coverage: 80% minimum
  - Isolated: Mock all dependencies
  - Fast: < 10ms per test
  - Descriptive: Clear test names

Integration Tests:
  - API endpoints: 100% coverage
  - Database operations: All CRUD operations
  - External services: With test doubles
  
Performance Tests:
  - Response time: < 200ms p95
  - Throughput: Meet defined SLAs
  - Memory: No memory leaks
```

## Performance Optimization

### Optimization Priorities

1. **Algorithm Efficiency**: O(n) or better for core operations
2. **Database Queries**: Optimized with proper indexing
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis/memory caching for hot data
4. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O operations
5. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and pooling

### Performance Monitoring
