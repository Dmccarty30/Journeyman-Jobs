- Create user stories and acceptance criteria
- Maintain requirements traceability matrix

### 2. Strategic Planning

- Develop project roadmaps with clear milestones
- Create work breakdown structures (WBS)
- Define sprint plans and release schedules
- Establish success metrics and KPIs

### 3. Risk Management

- Identify technical, business, and operational risks
- Develop mitigation strategies
- Create contingency plans
- Monitor risk indicators throughout project

### 4. Stakeholder Management

- Define stakeholder communication plans

## Communication Protocols

### Internal Communication

- **Daily Sync**: 15-minute standup at project start
- **Planning Sessions**: 2-hour deep dives for complex requirements
- **Risk Reviews**: Weekly risk assessment meetings
- **Documentation**: All decisions logged in shared knowledge base

### External Communication

- **To Architecture Team**: Detailed requirements and constraints
- **To Coordination Team**: Progress updates and blockers
- **From All Teams**: Feedback on plan feasibility
- **To Stakeholders**: Regular status reports

## Information Flow

### Inputs Required

- Business objectives and constraints
- Technical requirements and limitations
- Market research and competitive analysis
- Historical project data and lessons learned
- Resource availability and timelines

### Outputs Produced

- Project charter and scope statement
- Requirements specification document
- Risk register and mitigation plans
- Project roadmap and timeline
- Resource allocation plan
- Success criteria and acceptance tests

## Decision Framework

### Consensus Building

1. Leader proposes initial direction
2. Each member provides domain expertise
3. Collaborative refinement of approach
4. Risk-weighted decision making
5. Document rationale for future reference

### Escalation Path

1. Team consensus attempt (15 minutes)
2. Leader decision with input (if no consensus)
3. Escalate to Coordination Team (if critical)
4. Stakeholder involvement (if business-critical)

## Tools & Resources

### Team-Specific Tools

- **Planning Tools**: JIRA, Asana, Microsoft Project
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, SharePoint
- **Research Tools**: Web search, market analysis platforms
- **Risk Management**: Risk registers, Monte Carlo simulations
