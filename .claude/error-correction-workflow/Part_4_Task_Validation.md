## VALIDATION GATE 2 OVERVIEW

### Purpose

Verify that the generated tasks are realistic, achievable, and will actually address the identified issues. Prevents generating tasks that can't be completed or that miss the mark.

### Who Validates

1. **Karen** - Assesses whether tasks are realistic and achievable
2. **Jenny** - Assesses whether tasks address requirements correctly

## KAREN'S FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT

### Command Template

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Karen: Assess the realism and feasibility of the generated master task list.

FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT:

1. ARE THESE TASKS ACTUALLY ACHIEVABLE?
   - Can these tasks be completed by the assigned agents?
   - Are the effort estimates realistic?
   - Could any task turn out to be much harder than estimated?
   - Are there hidden complexities not accounted for?

2. DO THESE TASKS ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE FINDINGS?
   - Will fixing these tasks actually resolve the issues?
   - Are solutions concrete, not vague?
   - Will implementation steps actually work?
   - Are there missing prerequisites?

3. ARE THE TASKS PROPERLY SEQUENCED?
   - Will Tier 1 tasks unblock Tier 2?
   - Are dependencies correctly identified?
   - Could any task fail if another fails?
   - Is the critical path realistic?

4. WOULD YOU BET MONEY THESE TASKS WILL WORK?
   - If we execute all these tasks, will the codebase be fixed?
   - Or will we likely discover more issues?
   - Are we missing any obvious tasks?
   - Could we end up with a "technically complete but doesn't work" situation?

REALITY CHECK:
- Look at 5-10 random tasks and assess them deeply
- Do the acceptance criteria actually measure completion?
- Could an agent mark "done" and still have the issue remain?
- Are solutions overly complex or missing pieces?

COLLABORATION:
- Reference @code-quality-pragmatist for assessment of solution complexity
- Reference @task-completion-validator for verification approach

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Feasibility assessment: Tasks are REALISTIC | SOMEWHAT REALISTIC |
   UNREALISTIC
2. Confidence level: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
3. Effort estimate assessment: REASONABLE | POSSIBLY OPTIMISTIC |
   LIKELY UNDERESTIMATED
4. Specific concerns about 3-5 tasks
5. Missing tasks or gaps
6. Recommendations for improvement
7. Final assessment: READY FOR EXECUTION | NEEDS REWORK
```

### Karen's Assessment Criteria

**Achievability Analysis:**

1. **AGENT CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT**
   - Can assigned specialists actually complete these tasks?
   - Are tasks within the scope of agent expertise?
   - Do agents have sufficient information to succeed?
   - Are there skills gaps that need addressing?

2. **EFFORT ESTIMATE REALITY CHECK**
   - Are time estimates realistic for the complexity?
   - Could tasks take significantly longer than estimated?
   - Are there hidden dependencies that weren't considered?
   - Is there buffer time for unexpected complications?

3. **SOLUTION PRACTICALITY ASSESSMENT**
   - Are proposed solutions actually implementable?
   - Do implementation steps make logical sense?
   - Are there missing prerequisites or dependencies?
   - Could solutions create more problems than they solve?

4. **CRITICAL PATH VALIDATION**
   - Will task sequence actually work in practice?
   - Are there single points of failure?
   - Could one task failure cascade and block everything?
   - Is the timeline realistic with parallel execution?

### Karen's Red Flag Detection

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**

1. **OVERLY OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES**
   - Complex tasks with very short time estimates
   - No contingency planning for difficulties
   - Assumptions about codebase simplicity
   - Underestimation of testing and validation time

2. **VAGUE OR AMBIGUOUS TASKS**
   - Tasks without clear success criteria
   - Solutions that are "to be determined"
   - Acceptance criteria that are subjective
   - Tasks that could be interpreted multiple ways

3. **MISSING PREREQUISITES**
   - Tasks that assume capabilities that don't exist
   - Dependencies on external factors not controlled
   - Required tools or environments not specified
   - Knowledge gaps not addressed

4. **COMPLEXITY UNDERESTIMATION**
   - Tasks touching multiple complex systems
   - Changes to core architecture with simple timelines
   - Integration challenges not considered
   - Testing requirements underestimated

## Jenny'S COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION

### Command Template

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Jenny: Verify the master task list correctly addresses all validated findings
and matches project requirements.

SPECIFICATION ALIGNMENT:
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Compare task list against specified functionality
3. Verify tasks will deliver what was promised

FINDING-TO-TASK VERIFICATION:
1. For each major finding category, verify:
   - Is there at least one task addressing this finding?
   - Do the tasks fully address the finding or partially?
   - Could the finding remain unresolved even if all tasks complete?

2. Check for missing tasks:
   - Were any findings left without assigned tasks?
   - Should any findings have multiple tasks?
   - Are there category gaps?

SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE:
1. Will completed task list meet all requirements?
2. Are there specification items not addressed by tasks?
3. Do tasks align with specified architecture/design?
4. Could any requirement remain unmet?

TRACEABILITY CHECK:
1. Can you trace each task back to source finding?
2. Can you trace each finding to at least one task?
3. Are there any findings without corresponding tasks?
4. Are there tasks without corresponding findings?

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Task list coverage assessment: COMPREHENSIVE | MOSTLY COMPLETE |
   HAS GAPS
2. Findings that are fully addressed: [count]
3. Findings that are partially addressed: [count]
4. Findings without tasks: [list]
5. Requirements alignment: ALIGNED | SOMEWHAT ALIGNED | MISALIGNED
6. Missing tasks to close gaps: [specific recommendations]
7. Final assessment: TASKS WILL DELIVER | NEEDS ADDITIONAL TASKS
```

### Jenny's Verification Process

**Specification Alignment Steps:**

1. **REQUIREMENTS MAPPING**
   - Compare each specification requirement to task list
   - Identify requirements not covered by tasks
   - Verify tasks align with specified architecture
   - Check for specification violations not addressed

2. **FINDING COVERAGE ANALYSIS**
   - Trace each validated finding to corresponding tasks
   - Verify findings are fully addressed, not partially
   - Identify findings without task coverage
   - Assess if task scope matches finding severity

3. **TRACEABILITY VERIFICATION**
   - Confirm bi-directional traceability (findings ↔ tasks)
   - Validate source references are accurate
   - Check for orphaned tasks (no finding source)
   - Ensure traceability chain is complete

4. **COMPLETENESS ASSESSMENT**
   - Evaluate overall coverage percentage
   - Identify critical gaps in task list
   - Assess if tasks will achieve stated goals
   - Verify scope matches analysis findings

1. **SECURITY GAPS**
   - Security findings without corresponding remediation tasks
   - Incomplete security vulnerability coverage
   - Missing security validation tasks
   - Inadequate security testing coverage

2. **PERFORMANCE GAPS**
   - Performance bottlenecks without optimization tasks
   - Missing measurement and validation tasks
