INITIALIZATION STEPS:

STEP 1: VERIFY AGENTS INSTALLED
Agents required:
✓ error-eliminator.md
✓ security-vulnerability-hunter.md
✓ root-cause-analysis-expert.md
✓ dead-code-eliminator.md
✓ identifier-and-relational-expert.md
✓ dependency-inconsistency-resolver.md
✓ performance-optimization-wizard.md
✓ codebase-refactorer.md
✓ standards-enforcer.md
✓ codebase-composer.md
✓ testing-and-validation-specialist.md
✓ karen-reality-manager.md
✓ Jenny-spec-auditor.md

Check: Display list of installed agents in .claude/agents/
If any missing: Install from Part 1 documentation before proceeding.

---

STEP 2: VERIFY DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
Required directories:
✓ .claude/agents/ (agents directory)
✓ .claude/skills/ (skills directory)
✓ reports/ (for generated reports)
✓ logs/ (for execution logs)
✓ workflows/ (documentation)

Check: Verify all directories exist with write permissions
If missing: Create using provided directory structure

---

STEP 3: ENVIRONMENT SETUP
Create workflow environment:
- Initialize execution log: logs/error_elimination.log
- Create workflow state file: logs/workflow_state.json
- Verify codebase accessible
- Verify all files readable

---

STEP 4: PRE-WORKFLOW VALIDATION
Final checks before starting:
- Codebase is version controlled (recommend backup)
- No uncommitted changes (recommend clean state)
- Documentation accessible
- All stakeholders aware

---

STEP 5: GENERATE INITIALIZATION REPORT
Create: logs/workflow_initialization.log

Report contents:
- Initialization timestamp
- Agents verified: ✓ All 13 installed
- Directory structure: ✓ Complete
- Permissions: ✓ Verified
- Codebase state: [committed/clean]
- Status: ✓ READY TO START

---

STEP 6: DISPLAY INITIALIZATION SUMMARY

Output:
"
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
