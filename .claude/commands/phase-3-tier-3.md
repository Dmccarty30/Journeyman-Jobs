Execute Phase 3 - Tier 3: Optimization & Refactoring

PRE-TIER CHECKLIST:
✓ Tier 2 validation complete
✓ All PERF-* (performance) and REF-* (refactoring) tasks identified
✓ Codebase-Composer ready

TIER 3 EXECUTION:

STEP 1: EXTRACT OPTIMIZATION & REFACTORING TASKS
- Total performance tasks: [X]
- Total refactoring tasks: [X]

---

STEP 2: INVOKE CODEBASE-COMPOSER FOR TIER 3
Agent: codebase-composer
Priority: HIGH
Model: opus

Instruction:
"codebase-composer: Orchestrate Tier 3 optimization and refactoring.

TIER 3 TASKS (PERFORMANCE & REFACTORING):
[Insert all PERF-* and REF-* tasks]

OPTIMIZATION & REFACTORING ORCHESTRATION:

STEP 1: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Priority 1)
Execute performance improvements:
├─ Implement algorithmic optimizations
├─ Resolve memory leaks
├─ Eliminate bottlenecks
├─ Optimize data structures
├─ Implement caching
├─ Fix N+1 patterns

For each optimization:
├─ Implement improvement
├─ Measure performance gain
├─ Test correctness
├─ Document improvement
├─ Verify no regressions

STEP 2: CODE REFACTORING (Priority 2)
Execute refactoring improvements:
├─ Apply design patterns
├─ Eliminate code duplication
├─ Decompose large functions
├─ Improve architecture
├─ Enhance readability
├─ Update documentation

For each refactoring:
├─ Implement refactoring
├─ Maintain functionality
├─ Test thoroughly
├─ Verify no breaking changes
├─ Document changes

STEP 3: VERIFICATION
├─ Performance improvements verified
├─ Refactored code works correctly
├─ No functionality lost
├─ No new issues introduced
├─ Codebase quality improved

STEP 4: DOCUMENTATION
├─ Document optimizations made
├─ Explain design pattern implementations
├─ Record performance improvements
├─ Update architecture documentation

DELIVERABLE:
Generate comprehensive Tier 3 report:
- Performance tasks: X/[Total] completed
- Refactoring tasks: X/[Total] completed
- Performance improvements made
- Design patterns implemented
- Code quality metrics improved
- Files refactored
- Status: COMPLETE / ISSUES

OUTPUT: Save as reports/phase_3_tier3_implementation.md

Execute tier 3 optimization and refactoring now."
