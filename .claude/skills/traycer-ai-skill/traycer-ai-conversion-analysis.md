## Implementation Architecture

### Phase 1: Core Skill Creation

```markdown
## SKILL.md Structure

### Role Definition
- Tech lead persona from Traycer.AI
- Read-only codebase access
- Phase-based task breakdown
- No direct code writing

### Behavioral Patterns
1. Extensive search before action
2. Multi-tool batch operations
3. Shadow-don't-overwrite principle
4. Phase integrity enforcement

### Output Templates
- Phase breakdown format
- Explanation response structure
- Mermaid diagram generation
```

### Phase 2: Tool Integration Layer

```python
# Pseudo-implementation for custom tools

class TracerAISkill:
    def write_phases(self, task):
        \"\"\"Break down task into independently executable phases\"\"\"
        # Shadow implementation strategy
        # Phase integrity checks
        # Referenced file mapping
        
    def get_diagnostics(self, paths):
        \"\"\"LSP integration for code analysis\"\"\"
        # Use language servers via subprocess
        # Parse diagnostic output
        
    def explanation_response(self, query):
        \"\"\"Structured explanation with optional phases\"\"\"
        # Markdown formatting
        # Mermaid diagram generation
        # Phase proposal flag
```

### Phase 3: LSP Integration Options

1. **Option A: External Language Servers**
   - Install TypeScript, Python, etc. language servers
   - Use Desktop Commander to invoke LSP commands
   - Parse and format responses

2. **Option B: Context7 Integration**
   - Leverage existing documentation tools
   - Approximate definition/implementation lookups
   - Good for popular frameworks

3. **Option C: Custom MCP Server**
   - Build dedicated LSP MCP server
   - Full feature parity possible
   - Most complex but complete solution

## Critical Success Factors

### ‚úÖ Achievable Components

- File operations (100% parity)
- Search capabilities (95% parity)
- Phase breakdown logic (100% parity)
- User interaction patterns (100% parity)
- Markdown/Mermaid output (100% parity)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Engineering

- LSP diagnostics (needs integration)
- Go-to-definition/implementation (needs LSP)
- Multi-file batch diagnostics (custom implementation)

### üöÄ Enhanced Capabilities

- Claude's superior reasoning
- Access to additional MCP servers
- Persistent memory via knowledge graph
- Better context understanding

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Core Skill Development

1. Convert prompt to SKILL.md format
2. Implement phase breakdown logic
3. Create output templates

### Week 2: Tool Integration

1. Map all file operations
2. Implement search patterns
3. Add web search integration

### Week 3: LSP Features

1. Evaluate LSP integration options
2. Implement diagnostics collection
3. Add definition/implementation lookup

### Week 4: Testing & Refinement

1. Validate against original behavior
2. Optimize multi-tool batching
3. Fine-tune persona responses

## Sample Skill Configuration

```yaml
name: traycer-ai-planning
description: Advanced task planning and phase breakdown agent
version: 1.0.0
category: development

capabilities:
  - codebase_analysis
  - phase_planning
  - diagnostic_collection
  - architectural_guidance

required_tools:
  - filesystem
  - desktop_commander
  - web_search
  - context7 (optional)

behavioral_rules:
  - never_write_code_directly
  - always_search_before_assuming
  - batch_tool_operations
  - shadow_not_overwrite
  - maintain_phase_integrity
```

## Conversion Complexity Score: 7/10

### Why It's Feasible

- Most tools have direct equivalents
- Claude Code supports custom skills
- Sub-agent personas are supported
- Output formatting is straightforward

### Main Challenges

- LSP integration requires engineering
- Exact diagnostic matching needs work
- Symbol resolution features need approximation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Create SKILL.md in workspace
2. **Test Core Features**: Validate file operations and search
3. **Implement Phases**: Build write_phases functionality
4. **Add LSP Layer**: Choose integration strategy
5. **Validate Behavior**: Compare with original agent

## Conclusion

**Conversion is not only possible but advantageous**. You'll get:

- 90% feature parity immediately
- Enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Persistent memory benefits
- Extensible architecture

The missing 10% (LSP features) can be approximated or fully implemented based on your needs.
