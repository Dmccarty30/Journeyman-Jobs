# Meta-Pattern Recognition

When the same pattern appears in 3+ domains, it's likely a universal principle worth extracting.

## Core Principle
**Find patterns in how patterns emerge to identify battle-tested solutions.**

## Process
1. **Spot Repetition**: Notice the same "shape" or logic in 3 or more different places.
2. **Extract Abstract Form**: Describe the pattern independent of any specific domain.
3. **Identify Variations**: Note how the pattern adapts to different environments.
4. **Check Applicability**: Determine where else this principle could be applied.

## Common Meta-Patterns
- **Caching**: Storing frequently-accessed data closer (CPU, DB, CDN, LLM Prompts).
- **Layering**: Separating concerns into abstraction levels (Networking, Storage, Architecture).
- **Queuing**: Decoupling producers from consumers with a buffer (Async processing, Message queues).
- **Pooling**: Reusing expensive resources (Connections, Threads, Memory).

## Red Flags
- Thinking a problem is "unique" when it likely isn't.
- Multiple teams solving "different" problems with the exact same logic.
- Feeling like "haven't we done something like this before?"
