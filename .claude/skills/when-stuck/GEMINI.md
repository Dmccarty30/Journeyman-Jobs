# When Stuck - Problem-Solving Dispatch

Different roadblocks require different techniques. Use this skill to identify the correct approach when you are stuck.

## Stuck-Type → Technique

| Symptom | Recommended Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Complexity spiraling**: Too many special cases, excessive if/else. | `simplification-cascades` |
| **Need innovation**: Conventional solutions aren't working. | `collision-zone-thinking` |
| **Recurring patterns**: Same issue in different places; reinventing wheels. | `meta-pattern-recognition` |
| **Forced by assumptions**: "It must be done this way"; can't question premise. | `inversion-exercise` |
| **Scale uncertainty**: Unsure if it will work at production limits. | `scale-game` |
| **Code broken**: Test failing, unexpected output, wrong behavior. | `systematic-debugging` |
| **Root cause unknown**: Symptom is clear, but the cause is hidden. | `root-cause-tracing` |

## The Process
1. **Identify stuck-type**: Match your symptoms to the table above.
2. **Load the skill**: Read the specific instructions for that technique.
3. **Apply technique**: Follow the process exactly.
4. **Combine if needed**: Use multiple techniques (e.g., find a pattern then simplify) if the first doesn't solve it.

**Don't force through a roadblock with the same failing approach. Stop, identify the type of "stuck", and switch techniques.**
