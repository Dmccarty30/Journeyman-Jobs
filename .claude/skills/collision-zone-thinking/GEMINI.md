# Collision-Zone Thinking

Revolutionary insights come from forcing unrelated concepts to collide. Treat X like Y and see what emerges.

## Core Principle
**Deliberate metaphor-mixing generates novel solutions.**

## The Process
1. **Pick two unrelated concepts** from different domains.
2. **Force combination**: "What if we treated [A] like [B]?"
3. **Explore emergent properties**: What new capabilities or patterns appear?
4. **Test boundaries**: Where does the metaphor break?
5. **Extract insight**: What actionable logic can we take back to the original problem?

## Common Collisions
- **Code Organization** as **DNA/Genetics**: Leads to evolutionary algorithms or mutation testing.
- **Service Architecture** as **Lego Bricks**: Leads to composable, plug-and-play microservices.
- **Error Handling** as **Circuit Breakers**: Leads to fault isolation and graceful degradation.

## When to Use
- You've tried every conventional approach in your domain.
- Solutions feel incremental rather than breakthrough.
- You need innovation, not just optimization.

**Wild combinations often yield the best insights. Don't be afraid to experiment with metaphors from physics, biology, or economics.**
