# Task Orchestrator Skill

## Overview

The Task Orchestrator skill provides a sophisticated system for breaking down complex projects into manageable, hierarchical task structures that can be efficiently distributed across specialized AI agents. This skill enables systematic decomposition of large-scale operations while maintaining clear dependencies, priorities, and execution paths.

## Core Philosophy

**Principle**: "Complex problems become simple through systematic decomposition and intelligent agent distribution"

This skill implements a three-layer hierarchy:

1. **Strategic Layer**: High-level project goals and milestones
2. **Tactical Layer**: Feature-level tasks and agent coordination
3. **Operational Layer**: Specific implementation tasks and validation

## Key Features

- Dependency-aware task generation
- Risk-based prioritization and critical path identification
- Resource allocation and agent matching optimization

### ü§ù Multi-Agent Coordination

- Dynamic agent selection based on task requirements
- Inter-agent communication protocols
- Conflict resolution and priority arbitration
- Load balancing across agent pools

### üìä Progress Tracking & Validation

- Real-time progress monitoring with milestone checkpoints
- Automated validation gates and quality checks
- Dependency resolution and bottleneck detection
