# Agent Coordination System

## Overview

The Agent Coordination module orchestrates the distribution and execution of tasks across specialized AI agents, implementing intelligent load balancing, conflict resolution, and progress monitoring. This system ensures optimal agent selection based on task requirements, domain expertise, and current workload.

## Agent Selection Algorithm

### 1. Task-Agent Matching Score

**Scoring Formula**:

```python
def calculate_agent_match(task, agent):
    domain_match = calculate_domain_similarity(task.domain, agent.specialization)
    complexity_match = assess_complexity_capability(task.complexity, agent.capability_level)
    workload_factor = calculate_workload_availability(agent.current_load, agent.capacity)
    success_rate = agent.historical_success_rate

    return (domain_match * 0.4) + (complexity_match * 0.3) + (workload_factor * 0.2) + (success_rate * 0.1)
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination Patterns

#### **Sequential Coordination**

**Use Case**: Tasks with clear dependencies
**Pattern**: Agent A → Agent B → Agent C
**Example**: Architecture → Backend → Frontend → QA

#### **Parallel Coordination**

**Use Case**: Independent tasks that can run simultaneously
**Pattern**: Agent A || Agent B || Agent C
**Example**: Multiple frontend components, different backend services

#### **Hierarchical Coordination**

**Use Case**: Complex tasks requiring oversight and specialization
**Pattern**: Coordinator Agent → Specialist Agents → Validation Agent
**Example**: Architect coordinates frontend, backend, and security specialists

#### **Collaborative Coordination**

**Use Case**: Tasks requiring cross-domain expertise
**Pattern**: Agent A ↔ Agent B ↔ Agent C (continuous collaboration)
**Example**: Performance optimization requires frontend and backend collaboration

### 3. Load Balancing Strategy

**Workload Assessment**:

```yaml
agent_capacity:
  max_concurrent_tasks: 3
  complexity_weighting: 0.3
  time_based_weighting: 0.4
  success_rate_weighting: 0.2
  specialization_weighting: 0.1

load_balancing:
  algorithm: "weighted_round_robin_with_specialization_priority"
  rebalance_threshold: 0.8
  overflow_handling: "queue_with_priority"
```

## Communication Protocols

### 1. Agent-to-Agent Communication

**Message Types**:

- **Task Handoff**: Transfer of task ownership and context
- **Dependency Notification**: Alert when dependent task is complete
- **Conflict Alert**: Resource conflict or priority issue
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Domain-specific information sharing

**Communication Channels**:

```yaml
channels:
  direct: "point-to-point agent communication"
  broadcast: "system-wide announcements"
  domain_specific: "within-domain specialist communication"
  coordination: "multi-agent orchestration messages"
```

### 2. Progress Reporting

**Report Structure**:

```yaml
progress_report:
  task_id: "unique_task_identifier"
  agent_id: "responsible_agent"
  status: "in_progress|completed|blocked|failed"
  completion_percentage: 0-100
  blockers: ["list_of_current_blockers"]
  next_steps: ["planned_next_actions"]
  estimated_completion: "datetime"
  quality_metrics:
    code_quality: 0-100
    test_coverage: 0-100
    performance_impact: "positive|neutral|negative"
```

### 3. Conflict Resolution

**Conflict Types**:

- **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple agents need same resource
- **Priority Conflicts**: Different agents have conflicting priorities
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Circular dependencies or blocking issues
- **Quality Conflicts**: Different agents disagree on approach

**Resolution Strategies**:

1. **Priority-Based**: Higher priority task takes precedence
2. **Time-Based**: Earlier assigned task maintains priority
3. **Specialization-Based**: Most specialized agent wins
4. **Negotiation**: Agents collaborate to find compromise

## Performance Monitoring

### 1. Agent Performance Metrics

**Key Performance Indicators**:

- **Task Completion Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
- **Average Task Duration**: Time taken to complete typical tasks
- **Quality Score**: Code quality, test coverage, and correctness
- **Collaboration Score**: Effectiveness in multi-agent scenarios

**Metrics Collection**:

```yaml
agent_metrics:
  collection_frequency: "per_task"
  retention_period: "90_days"
  aggregation_level: "daily|weekly|monthly"

performance_benchmarks:
  min_completion_rate: 0.95
  max_average_duration: "4_hours"
  min_quality_score: 0.85
  min_collaboration_score: 0.80
```

### 2. System-Level Monitoring

**Orchestration Health**:

- **Queue Depth**: Number of tasks waiting for assignment
- **Agent Utilization**: Percentage of agents actively working
- **Throughput**: Tasks completed per time period
- **Bottleneck Detection**: Identification of system constraints

**Alerting Thresholds**:

```yaml
alerts:
  queue_depth_warning: 10
  queue_depth_critical: 25
  agent_utilization_warning: 0.90
  agent_utilization_critical: 0.95
  throughput_degradation: 0.80  # 80% of baseline
```

## Adaptive Optimization

### 1. Learning System

**Pattern Recognition**:

- **Task-Agent Success Patterns**: Identify successful task-agent pairings
- **Domain Specialization Evolution**: Detect emerging specializations
- **Collaboration Patterns**: Recognize effective agent combinations
- **Workflow Optimization**: Improve task sequencing and coordination

**Adaptation Mechanisms**:

```yaml
learning_system:
  feedback_loop: "continuous_performance_monitoring"
  model_updates: "weekly"
  pattern_recognition: "machine_learning_based"
  adaptation_triggers:
    - "performance_degradation"
    - "new_agent_capabilities"
    - "changing_task_patterns"
```

### 2. Dynamic Reconfiguration

**Rebalancing Triggers**:

- **Workload Imbalance**: Some agents overloaded while others idle
- **Performance Issues**: Agents underperforming on specific task types
- **New Capabilities**: Agents acquire new skills or specializations
- **Priority Changes**: System-wide priority shifts requiring reassignment

**Reconfiguration Process**:

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate current system state and performance
2. **Planning**: Generate new agent assignment strategy
3. **Migration**: Safely transfer tasks between agents
4. **Validation**: Confirm improved performance after reconfiguration
