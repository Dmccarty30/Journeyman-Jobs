# Task Generation Expert Logic

## Overview

The Task Generation module implements intelligent task decomposition algorithms that transform complex project requirements into hierarchical, executable task structures. This system combines complexity assessment, dependency analysis, and resource optimization to create optimal task distributions.

## Core Algorithms

### 1. Complexity Assessment Engine

**Purpose**: Automatically evaluate task complexity and determine appropriate decomposition level

**Algorithm**:

```python
def calculate_complexity(scope, domains, dependencies, risk_factors):
    base_score = (scope.size * 0.3) + (domain_count * 0.2) + (dependency_depth * 0.3)
    risk_multiplier = 1.0 + (risk_factors.criticality * 0.2)
    return base_score * risk_multiplier
```

**Complexity Thresholds**:

- **Simple** (0.0-0.3): Single component, <10 files, single domain
- **Moderate** (0.3-0.7): Multi-component, 10-50 files, 2-3 domains
- **Complex** (0.7-0.9): System-wide, 50-200 files, 4+ domains
- **Enterprise** (0.9-1.0): Cross-system, 200+ files, 5+ domains, high risk

### 2. Hierarchical Decomposition Strategy

**Three-Layer Architecture**:

#### Layer 1: Strategic Tasks (Epics)

- Timeframe: Weeks to months
- Scope: Major features or system overhauls
- Dependencies: Cross-functional coordination required
- Examples: "Implement authentication system", "Migrate to microservices"

#### Layer 2: Tactical Tasks (Features)

- Timeframe: Days to weeks
- Scope: Individual features or components
- Dependencies: Limited to 2-3 other tasks
- Examples: "Create login UI", "Design user database schema"

#### Layer 3: Operational Tasks (Implementation)

- Timeframe: Hours to days
- Scope: Specific code changes or configurations
- Dependencies: Typically 0-1 dependencies
- Examples: "Implement password validation", "Create JWT service"

### 3. Dependency Analysis Engine

**Dependency Types**:

- **Hard Dependencies**: Must complete before task can start (blocking)
- **Soft Dependencies**: Recommended but not required (advisory)
- **Resource Dependencies**: Shared resources or tools needed
- **Knowledge Dependencies**: Domain expertise or information required

**Dependency Resolution**:

```yaml
dependency_graph:
  algorithm: "topological_sort_with_priority_weighting"
  conflict_resolution: "critical_path_first"
  cycle_detection: "depth_first_search"
  optimization: "minimize_critical_path_length"
```

### 4. Risk-Based Prioritization

**Risk Assessment Matrix**:

| Impact \ Probability | Low (0.2) | Medium (0.5) | High (0.8) |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **High** (0.8) | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium** (0.5) | Low | Medium | High |
| **Low** (0.2) | Low | Low | Medium |

**Priority Score Formula**:

```bash
priority = (business_value * 0.4) + (risk_score * 0.3) + (dependency_count * 0.2) + (effort_inverse * 0.1)
```

## Task Generation Process

### Phase 1: Project Analysis

1. **Scope Assessment**: Analyze codebase size, file types, and complexity
2. **Domain Identification**: Identify technical domains involved
3. **Dependency Mapping**: Map existing dependencies and relationships
4. **Risk Evaluation**: Assess technical and business risks

### Phase 2: Hierarchical Planning

1. **Strategic Decomposition**: Break project into major epics
2. **Tactical Planning**: Decompose epics into manageable features
3. **Operational Detailing**: Break features into specific implementation tasks
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Map and validate all dependencies

### Phase 3: Optimization

1. **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify and optimize critical paths
2. **Resource Balancing**: Distribute tasks across available resources
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Plan for contingencies and failure scenarios
4. **Validation Gates**: Insert quality checkpoints and validation steps

## Quality Assurance

### Task Quality Metrics

- **Clarity**: Task descriptions are clear and unambiguous (90%+ comprehension rate)
- **Completeness**: All necessary information and context provided
- **Feasibility**: Tasks are achievable within estimated timeframes
- **Testability**: Success criteria are measurable and verifiable

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Task has clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Dependencies are explicitly identified and validated
- [ ] Time and resource estimates are realistic
- [ ] Risk factors have been assessed and mitigated
- [ ] Success metrics are defined and measurable
- [ ] Rollback plans are documented for high-risk tasks

## Adaptive Learning

### Pattern Recognition

The system learns from previous projects to improve:

- **Effort Estimation**: Historical data improves accuracy over time
- **Dependency Prediction**: Common dependency patterns are recognized
- **Risk Assessment**: Historical risk patterns inform future assessments
- **Agent Matching**: Task-agent pairing success rates optimize future assignments

### Continuous Improvement

- **Post-Completion Analysis**: Compare estimates vs. actual outcomes
- **Agent Performance Tracking**: Monitor agent specialization effectiveness
- **Process Refinement**: Update algorithms based on success patterns
- **Knowledge Base Expansion**: Build repository of successful task patterns
