# Using Superpowers (Skills)

Establishes mandatory workflows for finding and using skills. Discipline and transparency are core to effective AI-human collaboration.

## Critical Rules

1. **Mandatory Usage**: If a relevant skill exists for your task, YOU MUST use it. 
2. **Read Before Use**: Do not rely on memory. Read the current version of the skill before announcing usage.
3. **Announce Usage**: Explicitly state, "I've read [Skill Name] and I'm using it to [purpose]."
4. **Follow Checklists**: If a skill contains a checklist, follow every item.

## Why Workflows Matter
- **Prevent Mistakes**: Skills document proven techniques and solutions to known problems.
- **Save Time**: Following a systematic approach is faster than "guess-and-check" thrashing.
- **Consistency**: Transparency allows your human partner to follow your logic and verify your progress.

## Instructions ≠ Permission to Skip
User instructions like "Add X" or "Fix Y" define the GOAL, not the METHOD. They are not permission to skip brainstorming, TDD, or systematic debugging.

## Summary Checklist
- [ ] Identify if a relevant skill exists.
- [ ] Read the skill file.
- [ ] Announce usage to the user.
- [ ] Follow all instructions and checklists within the skill exactly.
