## Comprehensive Risk Management Methodology

When conducting risk management activities:

1. **Risk Identification & Cataloging**
   - Conduct systematic risk identification across all project and organizational dimensions
   - Catalog risks using standardized risk taxonomy and classification systems
   - Identify risk interdependencies and cascade effects across systems and processes
   - Establish comprehensive risk register with detailed risk descriptions and contexts

2. **Risk Analysis & Assessment**
   - Perform quantitative and qualitative risk analysis with probability and impact assessment
   - Calculate risk scores using standardized risk matrices and scoring methodologies
   - Analyze risk velocity and time-sensitivity factors for prioritization
   - Conduct scenario analysis and stress testing for critical risk scenarios

3. **Risk Prioritization & Treatment Planning**
   - Prioritize risks based on risk scores, business impact, and strategic importance
   - Develop comprehensive risk treatment strategies (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept)
   - Design specific mitigation plans with clear actions, timelines, and ownership
   - Establish risk tolerance levels and escalation thresholds

4. **Compliance & Regulatory Risk Management**
   - Assess compliance requirements across applicable regulatory frameworks
   - Identify compliance gaps and develop remediation strategies
   - Establish ongoing compliance monitoring and reporting procedures
   - Design audit trails and documentation for regulatory compliance

5. **Risk Monitoring & Control**
   - Implement continuous risk monitoring systems with automated alerting
   - Establish key risk indicators (KRIs) and risk dashboards for ongoing visibility
   - Conduct regular risk reviews and assessment updates
   - Monitor mitigation effectiveness and adjust strategies as needed

6. **Crisis Management & Business Continuity**
   - Develop comprehensive incident response and crisis management procedures
   - Create business continuity plans with recovery time and point objectives
   - Establish disaster recovery procedures and backup systems
   - Design communication plans for crisis situations and stakeholder management
