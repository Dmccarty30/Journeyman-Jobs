# Implementation Plan: Crews

**Branch**: `001-crews-feature-for` | **Date**: 2025-01-15 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-crews-feature-for/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-crews-feature-for/spec.md`

## Summary
The Crews feature transforms Journeyman Jobs from an individual job-finding platform into a collaborative network where skilled workers form crews, share opportunities, and advance careers together. This implementation integrates with existing job_sharing infrastructure using Firebase Firestore for backend storage, Riverpod for state management, and real-time sync for crew updates.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Flutter 3.x / Dart 3.0+
**Primary Dependencies**: Firebase (Firestore, Functions, FCM), Riverpod, existing job_sharing services
**Storage**: Firebase Firestore with subcollections for crew members, Tailboard data, and messages
**Testing**: Flutter test framework with widget tests and integration tests
**Target Platform**: iOS 13+ and Android 8+ (mobile-first)
**Project Type**: mobile - Flutter application with Firebase backend
**Performance Goals**: <100ms Tailboard load time, real-time message delivery, 60 fps UI
**Constraints**: Offline-capable for essential features, <2% crash rate, optimized for field use
**Scale/Scope**: 10k+ users, 50+ screens for full crew functionality

**Structure Decision**: Mobile app structure (Flutter) with feature-based organization

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - Riverpod best practices for real-time crew state management
   - Firebase Firestore structure for optimal crew data organization
   - Integration patterns with existing job_sharing infrastructure
   - Push notification strategy for crew activities

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Riverpod patterns for real-time collaborative features"
   Task: "Find best practices for Firestore subcollections in crew/member relationships"
   Task: "Research Firebase Cloud Messaging for crew notifications"
   Task: "Analyze existing job_sharing_service.dart for integration points"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Firestore subcollection structure
   - Rationale: Optimal for crew member queries and real-time sync
   - Alternatives considered: Flat collection structure, separate collections

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Crew: id, name, logo, foremanId, memberIds, preferences, createdAt, roles, stats
   - CrewMember: userId, crewId, role, joinedAt, permissions
   - Tailboard: crewId, jobFeed, activityStream, posts, messages, calendar
   - CrewMessage: id, senderId, crewId, content, type, attachments, sentAt, readBy
   - CrewPreferences: jobTypes, minHourlyRate, maxDistance, skills

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Crew Management: create, join, leave, update, delete
   - Member Management: invite, accept, reject, remove, updateRole
   - Tailboard: getF

eed, postActivity, pinAnnouncement
   - Messaging: sendMessage, getMessages, markAsRead
   - Job Sharing: shareToCrews, trackApplications

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - `test/features/crews/integration/crew_management_test.dart`
   - `test/features/crews/integration/tailboard_sync_test.dart`
   - `test/features/crews/integration/messaging_test.dart`

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Create crew with 2+ members scenario
   - Share job to multiple crews scenario
   - Real-time message delivery scenario
   - Tailboard activity feed update scenario

5. **Update CLAUDE.md incrementally**:
   - Add Crews feature context
   - Document Firestore collection structure
   - Add Riverpod provider patterns
   - Include integration points with job_sharing

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, updated CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate ~30 tasks covering:
  - Firestore collection setup and rules
  - Data model implementation
  - Riverpod providers for crew state
  - Tailboard UI implementation
  - Messaging system integration
  - Job sharing integration
  - Push notification setup
  - Testing at all levels

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order:
  1. Data models
  2. Firebase services
  3. Riverpod providers
  4. UI screens and widgets
  5. Integration with existing features
- Mark [P] for parallel execution where possible

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No violations - implementation follows all constitutional principles*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (none)
