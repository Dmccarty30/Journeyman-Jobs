## 💡 ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Lack of Systematic Error Handling Strategy
**Finding:** No consistent error handling pattern across codebase
**Evidence:** Mixed approaches, inconsistent logging, poor user messaging
**Impact:** Unpredictable error behavior, difficult debugging

### 2. No Network Awareness
**Finding:** Application assumes persistent internet connectivity
**Evidence:** No connectivity checks, no offline mode, no queue mechanism
**Impact:** Poor mobile user experience, data loss

### 3. Insufficient Authentication Lifecycle Management
**Finding:** Token expiration not handled proactively
**Evidence:** No token refresh, no graceful re-authentication
**Impact:** Unexpected logouts, lost work

### 4. Missing Error Monitoring Infrastructure
**Finding:** No Crashlytics, no analytics, no alerting
**Evidence:** Error screenshots indicate production issues unknown to team
**Impact:** Reactive rather than proactive problem resolution

### 5. Poor Error → User Messaging Translation
**Finding:** Technical errors exposed to users
**Evidence:** Error screenshots suggest system-level error display
**Impact:** User confusion, trust erosion
