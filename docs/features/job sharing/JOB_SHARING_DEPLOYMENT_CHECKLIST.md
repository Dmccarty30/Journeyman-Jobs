## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Email Delivery Problems

**Symptoms**: Users not receiving shared job emails

```bash
# Check SendGrid activity
curl "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/messages" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SENDGRID_API_KEY"

# Check Cloud Function logs
firebase functions:log --only sendJobShare
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify SendGrid API key permissions
- Check sender reputation
- Review bounce/spam reports
- Test with different email providers

#### Deep Linking Failures

**Symptoms**: Shared links not opening app correctly
**Diagnosis**:

- Verify app store associations
- Check platform-specific configuration

**Solutions**:

- Re-verify domain associations
- Update app store metadata
- Test with fresh app installs

#### Performance Degradation

**Symptoms**: Slow sharing response times
**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check function performance
firebase functions:log --only sendJobShare | grep "duration"

# Monitor database performance
# Firebase Console > Firestore > Usage
```

**Solutions**:
