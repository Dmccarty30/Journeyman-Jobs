# Feature Specification: Crews Communication Hub

**Feature Branch**: `001-crews-feature-for`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This feature provides a central hub of communication between users. Especially the user's who travel together. The ones that do travel together often do so because they can slightly tolerate each other but more importantly, they share the same job and work preferences. So, that means that they 'Tramp' together, or travel. When one finds a plausible job, they will notify the other guys about the job, then they all bid for it and most of the time get it because they onboard as an entire crew. Which employers like because they get along with each other, they are more dependable, etc. So this feature, 'Crews' is exactly that reflected through my app."

## Execution Flow (main)

```dart
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Feature involves traveling electrical workers forming crews
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Tramp workers, crew members, employers
   ‚Üí Actions: Create crews, share jobs, coordinate group bidding, communicate
   ‚Üí Data: Crew memberships, job preferences, notifications
   ‚Üí Constraints: Work compatibility, group bidding coordination
3. For each unclear aspect:
   Review each requirement for vague terms:
   - "User-friendly" ‚Üí What specific behaviors?
   - "Fast response" ‚Üí What performance metrics?
   - "Secure" ‚Üí What security standards?
   Check edge cases for missing scenarios:
   - Error conditions
   - Boundary values
   - Concurrent usage
   Validate assumptions about:
   - User types and roles
   - Data sources and formats
   - External system integrations
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Clear user flow: Form crew ‚Üí Share jobs ‚Üí Group bid ‚Üí Get hired as unit
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Each requirement is testable with specific outcomes
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Crew, CrewMember, JobNotification, GroupBid entities defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   Content Quality Check:
   - No technical implementation details
   - Written for business stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections present
   Requirement Quality Check:
   - Each requirement has measurable success criteria
   - Requirements are unambiguous and testable
   - All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers resolved
   Scope Validation:
   - Clear boundaries defined
   - Dependencies and assumptions documented
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Who**: IBEW electrical workers ("Tramps") who travel together for work assignments across different locations.

**Problem**: These workers need to coordinate as a group when applying for jobs because they have compatible work preferences and travel together. When one worker finds a promising job opportunity, they need to quickly notify their crew members so they can all bid together, increasing their chances of getting hired as a complete crew unit.

**Actions**: Workers form crews, share job opportunities within their crew, coordinate group applications, and communicate about work preferences and travel plans.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am a traveling electrical worker, **When** I create a new crew and invite other workers, **Then** they receive invitations and can join my crew
2. **Given** I am part of a crew, **When** I find a job that matches our preferences, **Then** I can share it with my crew members who get notified immediately
3. **Given** my crew mate shared a job opportunity, **When** I view the job details, **Then** I can indicate my interest and coordinate with the crew for a group application
4. **Given** our crew is applying for a job together, **When** we submit our group bid, **Then** the employer sees us as a coordinated crew unit
5. **Given** I am in a crew, **When** crew members communicate about job preferences or travel plans, **Then** I receive updates and can participate in discussions

### Edge Cases

- Crew member becomes inactive or leaves the group and is unresponsive for 45-days that member will be removed from that crew
- Multiple crew members find the same job independently
- Crew member applies for a job individually without notifying the crew is absolutely fine. It is not up to Journeyman Jobs to regulate grown men
- Network connectivity issues preventing job notifications from reaching all crew members
- Crew size limits and management up to ten members per crew
- Conflicting job preferences within the crew will be decided by the crew vote. If unsucceful then the crew forman will make the final dicision. Users can have individual preferences as well as different crew preferences

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
