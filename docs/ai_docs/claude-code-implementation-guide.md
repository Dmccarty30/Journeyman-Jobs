# Claude Code Multi-Agent Implementation Strategy

> **IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP**: Step-by-step guide to establish and validate the advanced multi-agent architecture in your project environment.

## Phase 1: Environment Preparation & Initial Setup

### Step 1: Provide Context to Claude Code

First, you need to give Claude Code the master guide as context. Use this exact prompt:

```bash
claude "I need to implement a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with hooks for my critical project. I'm providing you with a comprehensive implementation guide that contains all the technical details, patterns, and best practices needed.

Please read and understand this guide completely, then help me implement this system step by step. This is an extremely important project that requires production-grade reliability, security, and automation.

The guide contains everything about subagents, hooks, security patterns, and integration strategies. After reading it, confirm your understanding and provide an implementation plan."
```

**Attach the master guide document** to this initial conversation.

### Step 2: Architecture Assessment Prompt

```bash
claude "Based on the guide you just read, analyze my current project structure and recommend the optimal multi-agent architecture setup. Please:

1. Examine my codebase structure and identify key areas that would benefit from specialized subagents
2. Recommend which subagents to implement first based on my project's specific needs
3. Identify security patterns that should be prioritized in my hooks
4. Suggest the implementation sequence for maximum impact

Then create a customized implementation plan for MY specific project."
```

### Step 3: Initial Setup Execution

```bash
claude "Initialize the Claude Code multi-agent architecture in my project. Please:

1. Create the complete .claude directory structure with all necessary subdirectories
2. Generate the settings.json file with production-ready configuration
3. Set up the core subagents (code-reviewer, security-auditor, test-automator) customized for my tech stack
4. Implement the essential hooks (PreToolUse security gate, PostToolUse processor, Notification system)
5. Create validation scripts to test the setup

Make this production-ready from the start with proper error handling and logging."
```

## Phase 2: Core Subagent Implementation

### Creating Specialized Subagents

#### Prompt for Code Reviewer Subagent

```bash
claude "Create a sophisticated code-reviewer subagent specifically tailored to my codebase. Analyze my project's:

- Include intelligent timing and priority
- Integrate with my existing communication tools

Create a notification.py hook with:
- Multi-provider TTS with fallbacks
