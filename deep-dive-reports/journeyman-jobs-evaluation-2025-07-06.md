## Detailed Findings

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES

#### 1. Firebase Configuration Missing
**Location**: `lib/main.dart:3, lib/firebase_options.dart`  
**Type**: Configuration/Infrastructure  
**Expected Behavior**: Firebase should initialize properly on app startup  
**Actual Behavior**: Missing firebase_options.dart configuration file  
**Error Messages**: Import references non-existent or incomplete configuration  
**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Attempt to run the application
2. Firebase initialization will fail during startup
