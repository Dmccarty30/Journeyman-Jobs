# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Fix Flutter layout errors by addressing RenderFlex unbounded constraints and update deprecated Color.withValues(alpha: ) calls to use withValues() for Flutter 3.27.0+ compatibility. The primary issue appears to be in the TailboardScreen where nested Row and Column widgets create unbounded constraints.

[Types]
Update color extension methods to support withValues() and fix RenderFlex constraints by adding proper width/height specifications or flexible layouts where needed.

[Files]
- lib/widgets/message_bubble.dart - Replace withOpacity() with withValues()
- lib/features/crews/screens/tailboard_screen.dart - Fix RenderFlex layout issues in JobsTab
- lib/utils/color_extensions.dart - Add withValues() support to ColorExtension

[Functions]
- withOpacityValue() in message_bubble.dart - Replace with withValues()
- Build layout functions in tailboard_screen.dart - Add constraints to prevent unbounded RenderFlex
- Color extension methods in color_extensions.dart - Add withValues() support

[Classes]
- MessageBubble class - Update color styling
- _JobsTabState class - Fix layout constraints in job cards
- ColorExtension class - Add withValues() method

[Dependencies]
No new dependencies required. Update existing Flutter dependency to 3.27.0+ if not already current.

[Testing]
- Verify layout renders correctly without RenderFlex errors
- Test color opacity transitions work properly
- Ensure UI is responsive across different screen sizes
- Test job cards display correctly with proper constraints

[Implementation Order]
1. Fix deprecated withOpacity() calls in message_bubble.dart
2. Add withValues() support to color_extensions.dart
3. Fix RenderFlex constraints in tailboard_screen.dart JobsTab
4. Test layout fixes across different screen sizes
5. Verify all color transitions work properly
