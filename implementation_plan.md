# Implementation Plan

Fix Flutter compilation errors in `lib/providers/riverpod/jobs_riverpod_provider.dart` to restore app buildability. The errors include syntax errors, missing methods, experimental feature conflicts, and duplicate code that prevent successful compilation.

## Overview

The Riverpod provider file contains several critical compilation errors that need systematic resolution. Issues include missing method implementations, syntax errors with unclosed braces, experimental Dart features that aren't properly enabled, and structural problems with function definitions.

## Types

Fix type system issues in the Riverpod provider file by correcting method signatures and ensuring proper return types for all functions. The main issue is the `suggestedJobs` function which has multiple fallback paths that could potentially not return values.

## Files

- lib/providers/riverpod/jobs_riverpod_provider.dart (single file modification)
  - Fix syntax error on line 680 (missing closing brace)
  - Move helper functions inside class scope or convert to proper class methods
  - Resolve duplicate code block at end of file
  - Fix dot shorthands experimental feature usage
  - Ensure all control paths in functions return appropriate values

## Functions

- _getRecentJobs() - Convert from standalone function to class method or refactor into existing provider methods
- _filterJobsExact() - Move into class scope as a static or instance method
- _filterJobsRelaxed() - Move into class scope as a static or instance method
- suggestedJobs() - Ensure all code paths return List<Job> values
- Fix any remaining undefined method calls after restructuring

## Classes

- JobsNotifier class - Ensure proper method organization and access to helper functions
- No new classes required, but existing class methods need restructuring

## Dependencies

- No new dependencies required
- Flutter SDK version (^3.8.0) supports all needed features
- Riverpod and Firebase dependencies are already properly configured

## Testing

- Run flutter build to verify compilation succeeds
- Test suggested jobs functionality to ensure filtering logic works correctly
- Check authentication flow still works properly
- Verify all Riverpod providers initialize without errors

## Implementation Order

1. Fix syntax error (missing closing brace) around line 680
2. Move helper functions (_getRecentJobs, _filterJobsExact, _filterJobsRelaxed) inside class scope
3. Remove/replace experimental dot shorthands with traditional syntax
4. Fix duplicate code block at end of file
5. Ensure all function return paths are valid
6. Run flutter build to verify fixes
7. Test core functionality (authentication, job loading, filtering)
