# THE FALLEN'

i need your help. I am starting to plan for a new feature in my app. This feature will be a single screen, two at max. The feature give any user to pay their respect to the fallen and severely disabled lineman whom lost their lives while on the job. Users will be able to write a decently large passage describing the person, remembering them, telling them there favorite stories, fondest moments, as well as the moment they heard... They can upload photos, videos, pretty much anything that meets the formatting requirements and isn't elastic, vulgar, disrespected, or in other word negative towards them or their families.

There will be a `pass the hat` operation that we lineman participate in where we pass a hard hat around the yard and office collecting donations to give to the surviving family members. Possibly through a service like go fund me..

What i need your help with is the technique architectural framework, the data schemas, UI-UX, how to build out the screens to invoke a somber, surreal and serious undertone. For this feature, the `apptheme` does not apply. This is serious and needs to be treated as such

## LEVELS OF CONCERN

- **CONCERN ASSESMENTS**

This form will asses the level of concern to give to the users submission providing context to these criteria:

- When the person passed Away
- How did that person pass away?
- What are the circumstance surrounding the incident?
- What does the family dynamics look like?

I need help brainstorming the rest of the assessment as well an algorithm for grading and ranking assessments.

- **LEVEL 1**

Level 1 is the lowest level of attention. This level is designated for fallen brothers of years past. No earlier than a years time. This level will allow for pictures and storeys from former co-workers and families. Brief time of being spotlighted.

- **LEVEL 2**

Level 2 is reserved for fallen brothers of 8 month to a year. This level allows for several picture from several users with a limited amount of 30 people sharing stories and comments in addition to immediate family members unlimited amount of sharing.

- **LEVEL 3**

Level 3 signifies the highest level of concern. This level identifies the most recent of our fallen brothers days to 4 months. at this level of designation there are no limits to the amount of pictures, stories, songs, comments, posts, etc. from either friends, family, or complete strangers. At this level Journeyman Jobs will initiate and start a go fund me account in leu of 'Pass The Hat' as the wife or designated next of kin as the benifitiary.

### LEVELS OF CONCERNS PRACTICAL INTERPRETATION

**Level 1** - The story is mentioned and highlighted at the top of the feed(so to speak) for that day and emphasized during peek hours.

**Level2**- The fallen is featured at the top emphasized for that initial day and remains in the top 10 fallen for five days.

**Level 3** - This fallen' is featured at the top for several days, has less limitations on uploaded photos, stories comments, posts, mentions, etc. and remains at the top of the fallen' for much longer(possibly weeks, unless over taken by more recent fallen')

**_WE MUST CREATE A SYSTEM THAT RANKS AND ORDERS THE POSITIONS OF THE FALLEN BASED OFF OF RELEVENCY, POPULARITY, COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND OUTREACH, TIMELINE... THIS SYTEM MUST BE FAIR AND AUTOMATIED_.**

### FOR THE FAMILY

There will be a section or segment of this feature reserved for the family members. For basically what every they would like to do or say. If they want to remember,post pictures, if they want to thank other people...Even if they want to blame, and yell and cuss at the people that they feel are responsible for the fallen'. They also have that right and i absolutely will allow and even encourage then to do so. Because honestly, if it is someones fault, then they need to be held accountable and it also may spark change, or an investigation that improves or implements real change in the safet culture. for journeyman electrician.

- **Pass The Hat**

- Nowadays it would be most reasonable to start a GoFundMe or third party donationing effort to help support the immediate family for the first 4 months. After which the accounts will be cashed out and closed and the proceeds will be given to the immediate legal next of kin.

### UI-UX

- **Wireframes**

I have a drawling of what id like the main screen to look like.

### IMPLEMENTATION

- **Navigation**

- **Widgets**

- **Providers**

- **Models**

- **Components**

- **Notifications**

- **Themeing**

### MISC

- I think that there must be some sort of filter or consorship of people being mean, negative, disrespectful to the families of the fallen' We still need to think on this one.

- **Dependencies**

I need some help with this part.
