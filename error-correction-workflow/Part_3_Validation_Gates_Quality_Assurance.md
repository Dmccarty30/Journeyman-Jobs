## VALIDATION GATE OVERVIEW

### Purpose of Validation Gates

Validation gates serve as critical checkpoints in the Error Elimination Workflow, ensuring:

1. **Work Quality**: Findings and implementations meet standards
2. **Specification Compliance**: All deliverables match requirements
3. **Practical Feasibility**: Recommendations can actually be implemented
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Issues identified before they escalate
5. **Progress Assurance**: Workflow only advances when ready

### Disagreement Resolution

When Karen and Jenny disagree:

```
DISAGREEMENT DETECTED
    ↓
Identify points of disagreement:
  - Karen: "This won't work in practice"
  - Jenny: "This meets all specifications"
    ↓
Each presents evidence and reasoning
    ↓
Attempt to find common ground:
  - Can concerns be addressed?
  - Are specifications incomplete?
  - Is Karen's risk assessment valid?
  - Is Jenny's interpretation correct?
    ↓
If no resolution:
  → Escalate to Error Eliminator Commander
  → Commander makes final decision
  → Document rationale
  → Proceed with decision
```

---

## REWORK PROCEDURES

### Rework Trigger

Any validation gate results in REWORK when:
- Critical specification gaps identified
- Implementation quality unacceptable
- Resource constraints impossible
- Timeline unrealistic
- Risk level unacceptable
- Karen and Jenny cannot agree

### Rework Process

```
REWORK INITIATED
│
├─ STEP 1: ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
│  ├─ What specifically failed validation?
│  ├─ Is it an implementation issue?
│  ├─ Is it a design/approach issue?
│  └─ Is it a specification gap?
│
├─ STEP 2: CLASSIFICATION
│  ├─ Implementation Error
│  │  └─ Fix and re-execute
│  ├─ Design Issue
│  │  └─ Redesign and re-execute
│  └─ Specification Gap
│     └─ Clarify requirements and re-execute
│
├─ STEP 3: CORRECTION
│  ├─ Address root cause (not just symptom)
│  ├─ Update specifications/tasks if needed
│  ├─ Communicate changes to team
│  └─ Prepare for re-execution
│
├─ STEP 4: RE-EXECUTION
│  ├─ Re-execute affected phase/tier
│  ├─ Generate new deliverables
│  └─ Document changes made
│
└─ STEP 5: RE-VALIDATION
   ├─ Karen re-assessment
   ├─ Jenny re-assessment
   ├─ If PASS: Proceed forward
   ├─ If CONCERN: Track concerns forward
   └─ If FAIL: Escalate or rework again
```

### Escalation for Unresolved Rework

If rework doesn't resolve issues after first attempt:

```
ESCALATION PROTOCOL

Issue persists after one rework cycle
        ↓
Escalate to Error Eliminator Commander
        ↓
Commander reviews:
  - What's failing?
  - Root cause analysis
  - Previous rework attempts
  - Recommendations from Karen & Jenny
        ↓
Commander decision:
  ├─ Additional rework with specific direction
  ├─ Alternative approach
  ├─ Skip this section and proceed (if low priority)
  └─ Reject workflow and start over
        ↓
Continue with decision
```
