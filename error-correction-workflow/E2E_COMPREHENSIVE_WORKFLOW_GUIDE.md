## PHASE 1: CODEBASE ANALYSIS

### Purpose

Conduct comprehensive analysis of the codebase to identify ALL issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance problems, architectural issues, and improvement opportunities.

### Input Requirements

- ✓ Target codebase path
- ✓ Project specifications (if available)
- ✓ Architecture documentation (if available)
- ✓ Specific areas of concern (optional)

### Output

- Report with 8 sections
- 50-200+ findings organized by domain
- Recommended approaches for each finding

### The Command

**Copy and paste this exact command:**

```bash
Error Eliminator: Conduct comprehensive full-stack codebase audit.

TARGET CODEBASE: [your-codebase-path] 
[e.g., /path/to/your/src, ./src, ~/projects/journeyman-jobs]

ORCHESTRATION: Invoke all 10 specialist agents in systematic 4-phase 
sequence as documented in your instructions:

PHASE 1 (PARALLEL EXECUTION):
  - Use security-vulnerability-hunter to conduct comprehensive security analysis. 
    Identify SQL injection, XSS, authentication flaws, data exposure risks, 
    and all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
  
  - Use root-cause-analysis-expert to analyze for all errors, exceptions, 
    logical flaws, runtime issues. Trace each to root cause with specific 
    file:line references.
  
  - Use dead-code-eliminator to scan for unused imports, unreachable code, 
    unused functions/variables, obsolete functionality. Create complete inventory.

PHASE 2 (SEQUENTIAL - Depends on Phase 1):
  - Use identifier-and-relational-expert to map hidden connections between 
    identified issues. Show how issues cascade across modules and dependencies.
  
  - Use dependency-inconsistency-resolver to audit all external libraries, 
    packages, internal module dependencies. Identify version conflicts, 
    unused/missing dependencies, inconsistencies.
  
  - Use performance-optimization-wizard to analyze for: slow algorithms, 
    memory leaks, inefficient data structures, bottlenecks, resource misuse.

PHASE 3 (SEQUENTIAL - Depends on Phase 2):
  - Use standards-enforcer to audit for style consistency, naming conventions, 
    formatting standards, documentation adherence. Create violations report.
  
  - Use codebase-refactorer to analyze code structure and organization. 
    Recommend refactoring opportunities, design patterns, architectural improvements.

PHASE 4 (SEQUENTIAL - Depends on Phases 1-3):
  - Use codebase-composer to create comprehensive implementation plan addressing 
    ALL findings from Phases 1-3. Design for seamless integration.
  
  - Use testing-and-validation-specialist to design comprehensive test suites 
    covering all identified issues. Ensure test coverage prevents regressions.

REQUIREMENT: ALL 10 agents MUST be explicitly invoked and fully execute their 
specialized analysis. No shortcuts or omissions.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Master Error Elimination Report with all findings organized into:
1. Security Findings (with OWASP classification)
2. Root Cause & Error Analysis (with traces)
3. Dependency & Relationship Mapping (with cascade analysis)
4. Performance & Optimization (with bottleneck ranking)
5. Code Quality & Standards (with violations list)
6. Architectural Improvements (with recommendations)
7. Dead Code Inventory (with file:line references)
8. Testing & Validation Strategy (with test categories)

Each finding must include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Specific file paths and line numbers
- Code snippets showing the problem
- Why it matters (severity and impact)
- Recommended approach to fix
- Which agent identified this

Provide the COMPLETE report with every section populated.
```

### What to Expect

## VALIDATION GATE 1: ANALYSIS QUALITY CHECK

### Purpose

Verify that the analysis findings are real, meaningful, and accurately reflect the actual codebase state. This prevents wasting time on false findings or misdiagnosed issues.

### Who Validates

1. **Karen** - Reality manager validates findings make sense
2. **Jenny** - Auditor validates findings match actual codebase

### Karen's Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Karen: Perform reality assessment of the Error Eliminator analysis report.

VALIDATION FOCUS:
- Are the identified findings REAL issues or false positives?
- Do findings describe actual broken code or speculative concerns?
- Are security vulnerabilities exploitable in practice?
- Do performance bottlenecks impact actual use?
- Are the root causes accurately traced?
- Could the codebase actually be affected by these issues?

VALIDATION METHOD:
1. Cross-reference each finding against the actual codebase
2. Spot-check several findings by examining the code
3. Assess whether findings are critical to fix or theoretical
4. Identify any obvious false positives
5. Note any major findings that might be missing

COLLABORATION:
- Use @task-completion-validator for technical verification of findings
- Use @code-quality-pragmatist to assess if issues are real problems
- Cross-reference with Jenny's assessment

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Honest assessment: Are the findings legitimate?
2. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low) for each finding category
3. Any obvious false positives identified
4. Findings that might be missing
5. Overall assessment: READY TO PROCEED or NEEDS REWORK

Categorize as: KEEP | INVESTIGATE FURTHER | LIKELY FALSE POSITIVE
```

### Jenny's Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Jenny: Verify the Error Eliminator analysis findings against the actual 
codebase and project specifications.

SPECIFICATION REVIEW:
1. Read project specifications (if available)
2. Understand intended functionality and requirements
3. Compare actual code against specified requirements

FINDING VERIFICATION:
For each major finding category:
1. Examine actual code files referenced in findings
2. Verify findings accurately describe the code
3. Confirm the code actually has the described issues
4. Check if issues violate specifications
5. Identify any findings that don't match actual code

CODEBASE EXAMINATION:
- Use file inspection tools to verify specific findings
- Trace code execution paths to confirm logical flaws
- Check configuration for dependency/version issues
- Validate security findings are real vulnerabilities

VERIFICATION CATEGORIES:
For each finding, mark as:
- VERIFIED: Finding is accurate and confirmed
- PARTIALLY ACCURATE: Finding has some truth but overstated
- UNVERIFIED: Cannot confirm finding in actual code
- FALSE: Finding doesn't match actual code state

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Verification summary by section
2. Specific findings that are unverified or inaccurate
3. Recommended adjustments to the analysis
4. Additional findings that might have been missed
5. Assessment: FINDINGS ARE SOLID or FINDINGS NEED REVIEW

Critical Decision Points:
- Are security findings real vulnerabilities?
- Are root causes accurately identified?
- Do reported issues actually exist in code?
- Do identified gaps match actual gaps in codebase?
```

### Decision Tree: What Happens After Gate 1

```

## PHASE 2: TASK GENERATION FROM FINDINGS

### Purpose

Convert the validated analysis findings into atomic, sequenced, agent-assigned tasks that can be executed reliably to fix all identified issues.

### Prerequisites

- ✅ VALIDATION GATE 1 has passed
- ✅ Karen confirmed findings are real
- ✅ Jenny confirmed findings match actual codebase

### Input

- Error Eliminator report (8 sections, validated findings)
- All 200+ findings to convert to tasks

### Output

- Master task list: `hierarchical-initialization-tasks.md`
- 50-100+ atomic, sequenced, assignable tasks
- Full traceability from findings to tasks
- Agent assignments and acceptance criteria

### The Command

**Copy and paste this exact command:**

```bash
Task-Expert: Convert the validated Error Eliminator analysis report into 
a comprehensive master task list.

SKILL FRAMEWORK REFERENCE:
Apply the complete Task Generation SKILL framework from 
.claude/skills/task-generation/SKILL.md

ANALYSIS REPORT INPUT:
[Report from Error Eliminator with 8 sections and validated findings]

PROCESS (Follow All 10 Steps):

STEP 1: VALIDATE INPUT ANALYSIS
- Confirm report has all 8 sections populated
- Verify each finding has specific file:line references
- Ensure findings are marked as verified by Karen & Jenny
- Check for any obviously invalid findings

STEP 2: PARSE REPORT STRUCTURE
- Extract all findings from each section
- Note dependencies between sections
- Document cross-section relationships
- Flag any missing or incomplete findings

STEP 3: EVALUATE EACH FINDING
For each of the 50-200+ findings:
- Is this ACTIONABLE? (Can we create a task for it?)
- Does a SOLUTION exist? (Can we fix it?)
- Are there DEPENDENCIES? (What must be done first?)
- Is this a DUPLICATE? (Already covered by another task?)

STEP 4: GENERATE TASKS
For each actionable finding, create complete task with:
- Unique ID: [DOMAIN-SEQUENCE] (SEC-001, PERF-012, etc.)
- Clear title: [Action] [Object] [Context]
- Source traceability: Which agent found it, file:line
- Issue description: Problem, why it matters, where
- Solution specification: Approach, steps, code examples
- Agent assignment: Which specialist agent executes
- Difficulty: Low | Medium | High
- Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- Dependencies: What must finish first
- Acceptance criteria: How to verify completion
- Estimated effort: Hours to complete

STEP 5: DECOMPOSE COMPLEX TASKS
- Tasks >12 hours → break into subtasks with dependencies
- Multi-domain tasks → consider splitting
- Verify each task is atomic and independently executable

STEP 6: MAP ALL DEPENDENCIES
- Create dependency graph
- Check for circular dependencies
- Determine execution levels (0-4)
- Identify parallel execution opportunities
- Verify no task is blocked indefinitely

STEP 7: SEQUENCE & PRIORITIZE
- Apply severity prioritization (Critical first)
- Apply dependency ordering
- Organize by domain and agent
- Create execution timeline

STEP 8: ELIMINATE REDUNDANCY
- Compare task titles for >80% overlap
- Merge overlapping tasks
- Consolidate implementation steps
- Update all dependencies

STEP 9: QUALITY REVIEW
Run comprehensive quality checklist:
☐ Every task has unique ID
☐ Every task has clear title
☐ Every task traces to source finding
☐ Every task has acceptance criteria
☐ Every task has agent assignment
☐ No circular dependencies
☐ Severity distribution is reasonable
☐ Difficulty assessments are consistent
☐ Effort estimates are realistic
☐ Sequencing is logical

STEP 10: GENERATE MASTER DOCUMENT
Create hierarchical-initialization-tasks.md with:
1. Executive summary
2. Tier 1: CRITICAL tasks (MUST execute first)
3. Tier 2: HIGH priority tasks
4. Tier 3: MEDIUM priority tasks
5. Tier 4: LOW priority tasks
6. Dependency graph
7. Implementation notes
8. Task reference table

TASK DETAILS REQUIRED:
For EACH task, include:
- Task ID
- Clear title
- Source finding & discovering agent
- Issue description with code snippet
- Solution approach & implementation steps
- Recommended agent
- Difficulty level
- Severity rating
- Blocking dependencies
- Acceptance criteria (objective, measurable)
- Estimated effort
- Status: [Pending]

AGENT ASSIGNMENT REFERENCE:
SEC-* → security-vulnerability-hunter
ROOT-* → root-cause-analysis-expert
REL-* → identifier-and-relational-expert
ARCH-* → codebase-refactorer
PERF-* → performance-optimization-wizard
DEAD-* → dead-code-eliminator
DEP-* → dependency-inconsistency-resolver
STYLE-* → standards-enforcer

- Tasks organized in 4 tiers by priority
- All tasks sequenced with dependencies
- All tasks assigned to appropriate agents
- Comprehensive, prioritized, ready for execution

Provide the COMPLETE master task list, properly formatted and ready for 
agent execution.
```

## VALIDATION GATE 2: TASK FEASIBILITY REVIEW

### Purpose

Verify that the generated tasks are realistic, achievable, and will actually address the identified issues. Prevents generating tasks that can't be completed or that miss the mark.

### Who Validates

1. **Karen** - Assesses whether tasks are realistic and achievable
2. **Jenny** - Assesses whether tasks address requirements correctly

### Karen's Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Karen: Assess the realism and feasibility of the generated master task list.

FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT:

1. ARE THESE TASKS ACTUALLY ACHIEVABLE?
   - Can these tasks be completed by the assigned agents?
   - Are the effort estimates realistic?
   - Could any task turn out to be much harder than estimated?
   - Are there hidden complexities not accounted for?

2. DO THESE TASKS ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE FINDINGS?
   - Will fixing these tasks actually resolve the issues?
   - Are solutions concrete, not vague?
   - Will implementation steps actually work?
   - Are there missing prerequisites?

3. ARE THE TASKS PROPERLY SEQUENCED?
   - Will Tier 1 tasks unblock Tier 2?
   - Are dependencies correctly identified?
   - Could any task fail if another fails?
   - Is the critical path realistic?

4. WOULD YOU BET MONEY THESE TASKS WILL WORK?
   - If we execute all these tasks, will the codebase be fixed?
   - Or will we likely discover more issues?
   - Are we missing any obvious tasks?
   - Could we end up with a "technically complete but doesn't work" situation?

REALITY CHECK:
- Look at 5-10 random tasks and assess them deeply
- Do the acceptance criteria actually measure completion?
- Could an agent mark "done" and still have the issue remain?
- Are solutions overly complex or missing pieces?

COLLABORATION:
- Reference @code-quality-pragmatist for assessment of solution complexity
- Reference @task-completion-validator for verification approach

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Feasibility assessment: Tasks are REALISTIC | SOMEWHAT REALISTIC | 
   UNREALISTIC

### Jenny's Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Jenny: Verify the master task list correctly addresses all validated findings 
and matches project requirements.

SPECIFICATION ALIGNMENT:
1. Read project specifications and requirements
2. Compare task list against specified functionality
3. Verify tasks will deliver what was promised

FINDING-TO-TASK VERIFICATION:
1. For each major finding category, verify:
   - Is there at least one task addressing this finding?
   - Do the tasks fully address the finding or partially?
   - Could the finding remain unresolved even if all tasks complete?
   
2. Check for missing tasks:
   - Were any findings left without assigned tasks?
   - Should any findings have multiple tasks?
   - Are there category gaps?

SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE:
1. Will completed task list meet all requirements?
2. Are there specification items not addressed by tasks?
3. Do tasks align with specified architecture/design?
4. Could any requirement remain unmet?

TRACEABILITY CHECK:
1. Can you trace each task back to source finding?
2. Can you trace each finding to at least one task?
3. Are there any findings without corresponding tasks?
4. Are there tasks without corresponding findings?

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Task list coverage assessment: COMPREHENSIVE | MOSTLY COMPLETE | 
   HAS GAPS
2. Findings that are fully addressed: [count]
3. Findings that are partially addressed: [count]
4. Findings without tasks: [list]
5. Requirements alignment: ALIGNED | SOMEWHAT ALIGNED | MISALIGNED
6. Missing tasks to close gaps: [specific recommendations]
7. Final assessment: TASKS WILL DELIVER | NEEDS ADDITIONAL TASKS

### VALIDATION GATE 2 PASS ✅

If Karen and Jenny confirm tasks are solid:

**Proceed to PHASE 3 with:**

```bash
Confirmed master task list ready for execution:
- [X] Tasks are realistic (Karen confirms)
- [X] Tasks address all findings (Jenny confirms)
- [X] Ready for agent execution
- [X] Ready to proceed to Agent-Organizer distribution
```

### VALIDATION GATE 2 FAIL ❌

If Karen or Jenny identify major issues:

**Return to Task Generation with:**

```bash
Task-Expert: REWORK the master task list based on validation feedback.

REWORK AREAS:
[List specific task issues identified by Karen & Jenny]

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED:
- [Specific task to revise or add]
- [Dependencies to fix]
- [Missing tasks to add]

VALIDATION FEEDBACK:
[Paste specific concerns from Karen and Jenny]

REVISED MASTER TASK LIST:
Generate updated hierarchical-initialization-tasks.md addressing:
1. All identified feasibility concerns
2. All missed findings
3. Corrected dependencies
4. Revised effort estimates
5. Additional tasks identified as missing
```

---

## PHASE 3A: EXECUTE TIER 1 (CRITICAL TASKS)

### Purpose

Execute all critical tasks that must be fixed before anything else. Tier 1 contains blocking issues that prevent the system from working reliably.

### Prerequisites

- ✅ VALIDATION GATE 2 has passed
- ✅ Karen confirmed tasks are realistic
- ✅ Jenny confirmed tasks address findings
- ✅ Master task list is finalized

### Tier 1 Characteristics

- **Critical Severity** - Must fix immediately
- **Blocking Issues** - Prevent other work from proceeding
- **Security Vulnerabilities** - Active exploit paths
- **System Failures** - Complete breakage scenarios
- **Data Loss Risks** - Could damage data

### The Command: Initial Tier 1 Kickoff

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Agent-Organizer: Execute TIER 1 (CRITICAL) tasks from the master task list.

TIER 1 SCOPE:
Execute all tasks marked as CRITICAL severity from 
hierarchical-initialization-tasks.md

DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY:
Route tasks to specialist agents based on task domain:
- SEC-* (Security) → security-vulnerability-hunter
- ROOT-* (Root Cause) → root-cause-analysis-expert
- ARCH-* (Architecture) → codebase-refactorer
- [Route other tasks to appropriate agents]

EXECUTION APPROACH:
1. For each CRITICAL task, provide:
   - Task ID and title
   - Full task specifications
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Estimated effort
   - Dependencies (other Tier 1 tasks that must complete first)

2. Route tasks respecting dependencies:
   - Start with tasks that have no Tier 1 dependencies
   - As tasks complete, unblock dependent tasks
   - Maintain parallel execution where possible

3. For each task assignment, say:
   "[Agent-name]: Execute this task:
   [Task ID]: [Title]
   [Full task specification from master list]
   
   Success criteria:
   - [Acceptance criterion 1]
   - [Acceptance criterion 2]
   - [etc]
   
   Status: Starting
   Assigned to: [Agent name]"

CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:
- Execute tasks in dependency order
- Start with "Level 0" prerequisites first
- Move to "Level 1" foundational tasks after Level 0
- Verify each task actually completes before moving next
- Update task status as progress occurs

PARALLEL OPPORTUNITIES:
[Identify which Tier 1 tasks can run in parallel]

CRITICAL PATH:
The sequence of Tier 1 tasks that determines minimum timeline

EXPECTED DURATION: [X hours based on task estimates]

BEGIN TIER 1 EXECUTION - Start with first non-dependent task.
```

### Parallel Task Execution Format

**For tasks that can run in parallel, invoke multiple agents:**

```bash
[security-vulnerability-hunter]: Execute SEC-001 
[root-cause-analysis-expert]: Execute ROOT-001 (parallel to SEC-001)
[codebase-refactorer]: Execute ARCH-001 (parallel to ROOT-001)
```

### Handling Individual Tasks

**Template for specialist agent task assignment:**

```bash
[Agent-name]: Execute Task [TASK-ID]: [Task Title]

TASK SPECIFICATION:
[Full task details from master list including:
- Issue description
- Solution specification
- Implementation steps
- Code examples
- Acceptance criteria]

SUCCESS INDICATORS (you're done when):
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1 is met
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2 is met
- [ ] Tests pass for this task
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Code follows project standards

STATUS UPDATE REQUIRED:
When complete, provide:
1. What was changed (files modified)
2. How you verified success (tests passed, etc.)
3. Any blockers encountered
4. Any issues discovered in implementation
5. Status: [Completed | Incomplete | Blocked]
```

### Real Example: Tier 1 Task Execution

```bash
security-vulnerability-hunter: Execute Task SEC-001

TASK: SEC-001: Fix SQL injection in getUserById function

ISSUE DESCRIPTION:
The getUserById function in auth/user-service.ts (line 87) constructs 
SQL queries using string concatenation, allowing SQL injection attacks.

Current (vulnerable):
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;

SOLUTION:
Replace string concatenation with parameterized queries.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Open auth/user-service.ts
2. Locate getUserById function (line 87)
3. Replace string concatenation with parameterized query
4. Pass userId as separate parameter
5. Add type validation for userId
6. Run security tests

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] Code uses parameterized queries with parameter binding
- [ ] SQL injection test passes
- [ ] No new security warnings
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
- [ ] Code review approved

STATUS: Please execute and report results.
```

### Success Criteria for Tier 1

Each Tier 1 task should report:

- ✅ Task completed
- ✅ All acceptance criteria met
- ✅ Changes committed to git
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ No new errors introduced
- ✅ Status updated to "Completed"

---

## VALIDATION GATE 3A: TIER 1 VALIDATION

### Purpose

After Tier 1 execution completes, verify that implementations actually work and don't introduce new problems. This is the critical quality gate before proceeding to Tier 2.

### Prerequisites

- ✅ All Tier 1 tasks have been executed
- ✅ All specialists report "Completed"
- ✅ Implementations have been committed

### Karen's Tier 1 Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Karen: Perform reality check on Tier 1 implementations. 

CRITICAL ASSESSMENT:

Do the Tier 1 implementations actually WORK?

1. FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION:
   - Can you test the security fixes?
   - Do they prevent the vulnerabilities they were supposed to prevent?
   - Did any fixes break other functionality?
   - Are there any side effects?

2. ACTUAL VS CLAIMED:
   - Did agents report "complete" but left work unfinished?
   - Are implementations only working in ideal conditions?
   - Would these fail under real use?
   - Could there be hidden issues?

3. INTEGRATION TESTING:
   - Do Tier 1 fixes work together?
   - Did one fix break another?
   - Is the system more stable than before?
   - Are error messages clearer?

4. RED FLAG DETECTION:
   - Are implementations overly complex?
   - Are critical pieces still missing?
   - Could implementations cause problems later?
   - Are error cases handled?

VALIDATION PROCESS:
- For 3-5 critical fixes, examine the actual code changes
- Test critical paths if possible
- Check for common pitfalls
- Verify claims match actual state

COLLABORATION:
- Use @task-completion-validator for objective verification
- Use @code-quality-pragmatist for complexity assessment

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Tier 1 functionality assessment: WORKING | PARTIALLY WORKING | NOT WORKING
2. Confidence level: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
3. Specific implementations to scrutinize
4. Any fixes that appear incomplete
5. Issues introduced by implementations
6. Overall assessment: TIER 1 IS SOLID | TIER 1 NEEDS REWORK

Critical Decision:
- Can we safely proceed to Tier 2?
- Or do Tier 1 issues need fixing first?
```

### Jenny's Tier 1 Validation Command

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Jenny: Verify Tier 1 implementations match specifications and solve 
identified issues.

REQUIREMENT VERIFICATION:

1. DO IMPLEMENTATIONS MATCH SPECIFICATIONS?
   - Read project specifications
   - Compare against actual implementations
   - Verify implementations deliver what was specified
   - Check for any deviations

2. ISSUE RESOLUTION VERIFICATION:
   - For each Tier 1 task, was the identified issue actually fixed?
   - Do fixes prevent the original problem?
   - Are there incomplete implementations?
   - Could issues recur?

3. FINDING-TO-IMPLEMENTATION TRACEABILITY:
   - Can you trace each finding that was addressed?
   - Can you verify the implementation fixes that finding?
   - Is anything missing from the specifications?
   - Do implementations go beyond specifications (over-engineering)?

4. CROSS-IMPLEMENTATION CONSISTENCY:
   - Are all implementations consistent with each other?
   - Do they follow consistent patterns?
   - Are there contradictory approaches?

CODE REVIEW:
For 3-5 critical implementations:
- Examine the actual code changes
- Verify they match task specifications
- Check they solve the identified problems
- Ensure they follow project conventions

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Specification compliance: COMPLIANT | MOSTLY COMPLIANT | NON-COMPLIANT
2. Issues that are actually fixed: [list with verification]
3. Issues that appear only partially fixed: [list]
4. Implementations that exceed specifications: [list]
5. Overall assessment: TIER 1 SOLVES ISSUES | TIER 1 INCOMPLETE | 
   TIER 1 NEEDS REWORK

Critical Decision:
- Do implementations actually solve the identified problems?
- Can we proceed to Tier 2?
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING & REWORK PROCEDURES

### What If an Agent Reports "Unable to Complete Task"

**Recovery procedure:**

```bash
Karen: Assess why the task couldn't be completed.

For task [TASK-ID]:
1. What was the blocker?
2. Can it be worked around?
3. Is the task scope too large?
4. Does the task need breaking into smaller pieces?

OPTION A: Simplify the task
- Break into smaller, more achievable subtasks
- Re-assign with reduced scope

OPTION B: Provide additional context
- Pass more detailed specifications
- Clarify acceptance criteria
- Provide code examples

OPTION C: Reassign to different agent
- Try codebase-composer for integration
- Try different specialist for specific domain
- Try different approach

Get task back on track.
```

### What If Karen/Jenny Find Major Issues Post-Validation

**Return to appropriate tier:**

```bash
[Specialist-Agent]: URGENT - Critical issue identified in [Task-ID]

ISSUE:
[Description from Karen/Jenny]

REQUIRED FIX:
[What needs to be done]

This is blocking [dependent tasks/Tier 2 progression].

FIX AND RE-TEST IMMEDIATELY.
```

### What If Task Completion Criteria Conflict with Specifications

**Escalate to Jenny:**

```bash
Jenny: Resolve conflict between task criteria and specifications.

CONFLICT:
- Acceptance criteria states: [criterion]
- Specification requires: [requirement]
- These conflict because: [explanation]

RESOLUTION:
Which takes priority?
How should task be adjusted?
What is the correct completion state?

Provide guidance for agent to complete task correctly.
```

### What If New Issues Discovered During Implementation

**Handle emergent findings:**

```bash
Karen: New issue discovered during Tier [X] implementation.

ISSUE DETAILS:
- Found during: [Task-ID/Agent work]
- Description: [What was found]
- Severity: Critical | High | Medium | Low
- When discovered: [During implementation]

ACTION:
- Does this block current Tier? YES | NO
- Should we pause work? YES | NO
- Can we schedule for Tier 3/4? YES | NO
- Or is it critical path? YES | NO

RECOMMENDATION:
[How to handle - immediate fix, defer, rework, etc.]
```
