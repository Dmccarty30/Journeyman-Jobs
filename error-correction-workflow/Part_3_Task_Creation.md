## SKILL FRAMEWORK APPLICATION

### What is the SKILL Framework?

**S** - **Segment**: Break down large remediation phases into atomic, indivisible tasks
**K** - **Knowledge**: Map each task to required domain expertise and agent specializations
**I** - **Interdependencies**: Identify explicit dependencies and sequencing requirements
**L** - **Levels**: Create hierarchical task structure (phases → milestones → atomic tasks)
**L** - **Leverage**: Optimize task sequencing for parallel execution and resource utilization

## THE TASK-EXPERT COMMAND

### Complete Command Template

**Copy and paste this exact command:**

```bash
Task-Expert: Convert the validated Error Eliminator analysis report into
a comprehensive master task list.

SKILL FRAMEWORK REFERENCE:
Apply the complete Task Generation SKILL framework from
.claude/skills/task-generation/SKILL.md

ANALYSIS REPORT INPUT:
[Report from Error Eliminator with 8 sections and validated findings]

PROCESS (Follow All 10 Steps):

STEP 1: VALIDATE INPUT ANALYSIS
- Confirm report has all 8 sections populated
- Verify each finding has specific file:line references
- Ensure findings are marked as verified by Karen & Jenny
- Check for any obviously invalid findings

STEP 2: PARSE REPORT STRUCTURE
- Extract all findings from each section
- Note dependencies between sections
- Document cross-section relationships
- Flag any missing or incomplete findings

STEP 3: EVALUATE EACH FINDING
For each of the 50-200+ findings:
- Is this ACTIONABLE? (Can we create a task for it?)
- Does a SOLUTION exist? (Can we fix it?)
- Are there DEPENDENCIES? (What must be done first?)
- Is this a DUPLICATE? (Already covered by another task?)

STEP 4: GENERATE TASKS
For each actionable finding, create complete task with:
- Unique ID: [DOMAIN-SEQUENCE] (SEC-001, PERF-012, etc.)
- Clear title: [Action] [Object] [Context]

## TASK GENERATION PROCESS STEPS

### Step 1: Validate Input Analysis

**What to Check:**

- All 8 sections from Error Eliminator report are present
- Each finding includes specific file:line references
- Findings have been validated by Karen and Jenny
- No obviously invalid or speculative findings

**Quality Gates:**

```dart
☐ Report contains all required sections
☐ Each section has multiple findings
☐ Findings include actionable details
☐ Source traceability is clear
☐ Validation status is confirmed
```

### Step 2: Parse Report Structure

**Extraction Process:**

- Security Findings → Extract all security vulnerabilities
- Root Cause Analysis → Extract all error origins and logical flaws
- Dependencies & Relationships → Extract all dependency issues
- Performance & Optimization → Extract all performance bottlenecks
- Code Quality & Standards → Extract all standard violations
- Architectural Improvements → Extract all structural issues
- Dead Code Inventory → Extract all unused code
- Testing & Validation Strategy → Extract all testing gaps

**Cross-Section Analysis:**

- Document dependencies between sections
- Note relationships between findings
- Identify overlapping issues
- Flag incomplete findings

### Step 3: Evaluate Each Finding

**Actionability Criteria:**

- **ACTIONABLE**: Can create a concrete task to fix this?
- **SOLVABLE**: Does a practical solution exist?
- **DEPENDENCIES**: What must be done first?
- **DUPLICATE**: Already covered by another task?

**Decision Matrix:**

```dart
Finding Assessment:
├─ Actionable + Solvable → CREATE TASK
├─ Actionable but No Solution → RESEARCH NEEDED
├─ Not Actionable → DOCUMENT AS CONSTRAINT
└─ Duplicate → MERGE WITH EXISTING TASK
```

### Step 4: Generate Tasks

**Task Structure Template:**

```dart
### Task [DOMAIN-###]: [Clear Action Title]

**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL / 🟠 HIGH / 🟡 MEDIUM / 🟢 LOW
**Estimated Time**: [X-Y hours]
**Assigned Agent**: [Specialist Agent Name]
**Difficulty**: Low / Medium / High

**Source Finding**:
- **Discovering Agent**: [Which specialist identified this]
- **Report Section**: [Section number and title]
- **File References**: [specific files and line numbers]

**Issue Description**:
- **Problem**: [Clear description of what's wrong]
- **Why It Matters**: [Impact on system/users]
- **Location**: [Where in codebase this occurs]
- **Code Example**: [Snippet showing the problem]

**Solution Specification**:
- **Approach**: [How to fix this issue]
- **Implementation Steps**: [Step-by-step instructions]
- **Code Changes**: [Specific modifications needed]
- **Testing Strategy**: [How to verify the fix]

**Dependencies**:
- **Blocking Tasks**: [Tasks that must complete first]
- **Dependent Tasks**: [Tasks that wait for this]
- **Prerequisites**: [Conditions that must exist]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Specific, measurable criterion 1
- [ ] Specific, measurable criterion 2
- [ ] Tests pass for this task
- [ ] No regressions introduced
- [ ] Code follows project standards

**Validation Steps**:
1. [How to verify completion]
2. [What tests to run]
3. [How to confirm no side effects]
```

### Step 5: Decompose Complex Tasks

**When to Decompose:**

- Estimated effort >12 hours
- Multiple domains involved (security + performance)
- Multiple distinct steps with different outcomes
- High risk of failure or complexity

**Decomposition Strategy:**

```dart
Complex Task (16 hours)
├─ Subtask 1: Analysis (4 hours) → Prerequisite
├─ Subtask 2: Implementation (8 hours) → Core work
├─ Subtask 3: Testing (2 hours) → Validation
└─ Subtask 4: Documentation (2 hours) → Completion
```

### Step 6: Map All Dependencies

**Dependency Types:**

- **Blocking**: Task B cannot start until Task A completes
- **Sequential**: Tasks must execute in specific order
- **Parallel**: Tasks can execute simultaneously
- **Conditional**: Task depends on decision or outcome

**Dependency Graph Rules:**

- No circular dependencies allowed
- Each task must have a clear execution path
- Critical path must be identified
- Parallel opportunities maximized

### Step 7: Sequence & Prioritize

**Priority Levels:**

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, system failures, data loss risks
- **🟠 HIGH**: Performance bottlenecks, architectural failures, feature blockers
- **🟡 MEDIUM**: Code quality, maintainability, minor performance
- **🟢 LOW**: Nice-to-haves, documentation, polish

**Execution Levels:**

- **Level 0**: No dependencies (can start immediately)
- **Level 1**: Depends on Level 0 tasks
- **Level 2**: Depends on Level 1 tasks
- **Level 3**: Depends on Level 2 tasks
- **Level 4**: Final validation and completion tasks

### Step 8: Eliminate Redundancy

**Redundancy Detection:**

- Compare task titles for >80% similarity
- Check for overlapping implementation steps
- Identify duplicate acceptance criteria
- Look for similar agent assignments

**Consolidation Process:**

```dart
Duplicate Tasks:
├─ Task A: Fix security issue in auth module
├─ Task B: Resolve authentication vulnerability
└─ Consolidated: Fix authentication security vulnerability
```

### Step 9: Quality Review

**Comprehensive Checklist:**

```dart
☐ Every task has unique ID
☐ Every task has clear, actionable title
☐ Every task traces to source finding
☐ Every task has specific acceptance criteria
☐ Every task has appropriate agent assignment
☐ No circular dependencies exist
☐ Severity distribution is reasonable
☐ Difficulty assessments are consistent
☐ Effort estimates are realistic
☐ Task sequencing is logical
☐ All findings have corresponding tasks
☐ Parallel execution opportunities maximized
☐ Critical path is identified
☐ Risk assessment is complete
```

### Step 10: Generate Master Document

**Document Structure:**

```dart
hierarchical-initialization-tasks.md
├─ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
│  ├─ Total tasks: [X]
│  ├─ Critical: [X] (%)
│  ├─ High: [X] (%)
│  ├─ Medium: [X] (%)
