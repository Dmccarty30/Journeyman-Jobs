## AGENT INSTALLATION

### Installing Individual Agents

Each agent requires two files: agent definition and system prompt.

#### Agent Definition File Format

```yaml
---
name: [agent-name]
description: [Clear description of purpose]
tools: [Tool list]
model: [opus/sonnet/haiku]
color: [red/orange/yellow/green/blue/etc]
priority: [critical/high/medium/low]
---

# [AGENT NAME]

[Agent system prompt below - detailed instructions]
```

#### Installation Steps

**Step 1: Create Agent File**

```bash
# Create agents directory if doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Create agent definition file (for each agent)
# Copy the agent definition from Part 1 into:
# .claude/agents/[agent-name].md
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**

```bash
# List installed agents
ls -la .claude/agents/

# Check specific agent is readable
cat .claude/agents/error-eliminator-commander.md

# Expected output: YAML frontmatter + system prompt
```

**Step 3: Agent Registration** (if using Claude Code)

```bash
# Claude Code auto-discovers agents in .claude/agents/
# No additional registration needed
# Available immediately for invocation
```

### Quick Agent Installation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# install_agents.sh

AGENTS=(
  "error-eliminator-commander"
  "security-vulnerability-hunter"
  "root-cause-analysis-expert"
  "dead-code-eliminator"
  "identifier-and-relational-expert"
  "dependency-inconsistency-resolver"
  "performance-optimization-wizard"
  "codebase-refactorer"
  "standards-enforcer"
  "codebase-composer"
  "testing-and-validation-specialist"
  "karen-reality-manager"
  "jenny-spec-auditor"
)

# Create directory
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Verify each agent file exists
for agent in "${AGENTS[@]}"; do
  if [ -f ".claude/agents/$agent.md" ]; then
    echo "✓ $agent installed"
  else
    echo "✗ $agent missing - install from Part 1 documentation"
  fi
done

echo "Installation check complete"
```

---

## SKILL INSTALLATION

### Task-Expert Skill

The Task-Expert skill converts analysis findings into actionable task lists.

**Installation:**

```bash
# Create skills directory
mkdir -p .claude/skills

# Create task-generator.md skill file
# Use the Task-Expert SKILL from previous conversations
```

**Skill Invocation:**

```bash
# When needed in Phase 2
> Task-Expert: Convert the following Phase 2 findings into a structured 
  task list with priorities, complexity estimates, and dependencies:
  
  [Insert consolidated Phase 2 findings]
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING & COMMON ISSUES

### Issue: Agent Not Invoking Completely

**Symptom:** Agent output seems incomplete or skipped sections

**Diagnosis:**
```
Check if:
1. Agent file is properly installed
2. Agent name is spelled correctly in command
3. System prompt is complete and clear
4. Input context is being passed properly
5. Token budget is sufficient
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Reinstall agent from Part 1 specifications
2. Use explicit agent name in commands
3. Break analysis into smaller sections if context overflow
4. Reference agent explicitly: "[Agent Name]: [Detailed instruction]"
5. If token budget exceeded, process in smaller batches
```

### Issue: Validation Gate Keeps Failing

**Symptom:** Karen or Jenny repeatedly reject work

**Root Causes:**
```
Karen failures typically mean:
- Implementation is not practical
- Resource/time estimates unrealistic
- Hidden risks not identified
- Code quality concerns

Jenny failures typically mean:
- Specifications not met
- Issues left unaddressed
- Documentation incomplete
- Quality standards not followed
```

**Resolution Process:**
```
1. Ask Karen/Jenny: "What specifically needs to change?"
2. Get concrete, actionable feedback
3. Address root cause, not just symptom
4. Re-execute affected phase/tier completely
5. Re-validate
6. If still fails after 2 attempts, escalate to Error Eliminator
```

### Issue: Workflow Stalling or Not Progressing

**Symptom:** Stuck on same phase/tier, no progress

**Diagnosis:**
```
Check:
1. Is it in rework loop?
2. Is a validation gate blocking?
3. Is context being preserved between agents?
4. Are dependencies blocking execution?
```

**Solution:**
```
1. Pause and explicitly summarize state:
   "Current workflow state: [Phase X, Tier Y, findings/issues]"
   
2. Break workflow into smaller segments:
   - One phase at a time
   - One tier at a time
   - Individual agent invocations
   
3. Explicitly pass context between phases:
   "Here is the complete Phase 1 output: [paste output]"
   
4. For blocked dependencies:
   - Identify what's blocking
   - Address blocker first
   - Then continue workflow
```

### Issue: Token Budget Exceeded

**Symptom:** Running out of tokens mid-workflow

**Prevention:**
```
Estimate token usage:
- Phase 1: ~15,000 tokens
- Phase 2: ~20,000 tokens
- Phase 3: ~25,000 tokens (per tier)
- Phase 4: ~10,000 tokens

Total: ~95,000-120,000 tokens

Reserve extra 20% buffer.
```

**Recovery if exceeded:**
```
1. Save current state/progress
2. Document what's been completed
3. Identify remaining work
4. Start fresh session
5. Reference prior output in new session
6. Continue from where left off
```

### Issue: Validation Takes Too Long

**Symptom:** Karen and Jenny assessments taking excessive time

**Optimization:**
```
1. Provide more specific context: "Focus assessment on X only"
2. Pre-summarize findings: "Here's 3-page summary of work"
3. Ask for quicker assessment: "Provide 2-minute assessment"
4. Break into multiple smaller gates: One tier at a time
5. Sequential assessment: Karen first, then Jenny (faster)
```

### Issue: Quality Keeps Improving But Gate Still Fails

**Symptom:** Work getting better but validation still rejecting

**Analysis:**
```
This usually means:
1. Gate criteria misunderstood
2. Different expectation than implied
3. Specification gap or ambiguity
4. Risk tolerance different than expected
```

**Resolution:**
```
1. Ask explicitly: "What specific acceptance criteria are not met?"
2. Get measurable, specific requirements
3. Address exact criteria, not general quality
4. Document criteria for future phases
5. If criteria unreasonable, escalate to Error Eliminator
```
