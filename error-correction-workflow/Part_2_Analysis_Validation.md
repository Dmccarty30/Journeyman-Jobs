## KAREN'S REALITY ASSESSMENT

### Command Template

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Karen: Perform reality assessment of the Error Eliminator analysis report.

VALIDATION FOCUS:
- Are the identified findings REAL issues or false positives?
- Do findings describe actual broken code or speculative concerns?
- Are security vulnerabilities exploitable in practice?
- Do performance bottlenecks impact actual use?
- Are the root causes accurately traced?
- Could the codebase actually be affected by these issues?

VALIDATION METHOD:
1. Cross-reference each finding against the actual codebase
2. Spot-check several findings by examining the code
3. Assess whether findings are critical to fix or theoretical
4. Identify any obvious false positives
5. Note any major findings that might be missing

COLLABORATION:
- Use @task-completion-validator for technical verification of findings
- Use @code-quality-pragmatist to assess if issues are real problems
- Cross-reference with Jenny's assessment

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Honest assessment: Are the findings legitimate?
2. Confidence level (High/Medium/Low) for each finding category
3. Any obvious false positives identified
4. Findings that might be missing
5. Overall assessment: READY TO PROCEED or NEEDS REWORK

Categorize as: KEEP | INVESTIGATE FURTHER | LIKELY FALSE POSITIVE
```

### Karen's Assessment Criteria

**Reality Check Questions:**

1. **ACTUAL VS THEORETICAL ISSUES**
   - Does the code actually break or just follow different patterns?
   - Are security findings exploitable in real scenarios?
   - Would performance issues actually impact users?

2. **CRITICALITY ASSESSMENT**
   - Are findings "must fix" or "nice to have"?
   - Do issues actually block functionality or just violate ideals?
   - Could we ship with these issues or would it be irresponsible?

3. **PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS**
   - Are fixes feasible within reasonable time/cost?
   - Would fixing create more problems than it solves?
   - Are we over-engineering solutions to minor issues?

4. **FALSE POSITIVE DETECTION**
   - Are findings based on outdated assumptions?
   - Do analysis tools misunderstand the codebase patterns?
   - Are there contextual factors the analysis missed?

## JENNY'S SPECIFICATION VERIFICATION

### Command Template

**Copy and paste this:**

```bash
Jenny: Verify the Error Eliminator analysis findings against the actual
codebase and project specifications.

SPECIFICATION REVIEW:
1. Read project specifications (if available)
2. Understand intended functionality and requirements
3. Compare actual code against specified requirements

FINDING VERIFICATION:
For each major finding category:
1. Examine actual code files referenced in findings
2. Verify findings accurately describe the code
3. Confirm the code actually has the described issues
4. Check if issues violate specifications
5. Identify any findings that don't match actual code

CODEBASE EXAMINATION:
- Use file inspection tools to verify specific findings
- Trace code execution paths to confirm logical flaws
- Check configuration for dependency/version issues
- Validate security findings are real vulnerabilities

VERIFICATION CATEGORIES:
For each finding, mark as:
- VERIFIED: Finding is accurate and confirmed
- PARTIALLY ACCURATE: Finding has some truth but overstated
- UNVERIFIED: Cannot confirm finding in actual code
- FALSE: Finding doesn't match actual code state

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Verification summary by section
2. Specific findings that are unverified or inaccurate
3. Recommended adjustments to the analysis
4. Additional findings that might have been missed
5. Assessment: FINDINGS ARE SOLID or FINDINGS NEED REVIEW

Critical Decision Points:
- Are security findings real vulnerabilities?
- Are root causes accurately identified?
- Do reported issues actually exist in code?
- Do identified gaps match actual gaps in codebase?
```

### Jenny's Verification Process

**Specification Alignment Steps:**

1. **REQUIREMENTS MAPPING**
   - Map project specifications to codebase features
   - Identify gaps between specifications and implementation
   - Verify analysis findings address actual specification violations

2. **CODE VERIFICATION**
   - Examine actual files referenced in findings
   - Confirm code snippets match analysis descriptions
   - Validate line numbers and contexts are accurate

3. **TRACEABILITY CHECK**
   - Can each finding be traced to specific code?
   - Are code examples accurate and representative?
   - Do findings reflect current codebase state?

4. **COMPLETENESS ASSESSMENT**
   - Are there specification violations not captured?
   - Did analysis miss any major issues?
   - Are findings comprehensive for each domain?
