   - Basic job model exists at `lib/models/job_model.dart` with classification field
   - Filter infrastructure exists with:
     - `lib/models/filter_criteria.dart` - filter model
     - `lib/providers/job_filter_provider.dart` - filter state management
   - Current filter options include basic types but not electrical-specific classifications

2. **Required Enhancements:**
   - Add electrical industry classifications (Journeyman Lineman, Journeyman Electrician, Journeyman Wireman, etc.)
   - Add voltage level categorization (Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, High Voltage, Extra High Voltage)
