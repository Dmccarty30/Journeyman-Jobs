  - Safety reminders

### Next Steps
1. Create power grid data models and mock data
2. Design UI components for power grid status display
3. Integrate electrical hazard indicators
4. Add electrical-themed visual components
5. Test the integration

### Files Modified
- lib/screens/storm/storm_screen.dart - Added power grid status section with electrical hazard indicators
- lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart - Fixed electrical component imports and missing methods
- lib/design_system/components/reusable_components.dart - Replaced electrical components with standard Flutter widgets

### Files Created

## Current Task: Step 1 - Enhance Jobs Screen with Electrical Classification Filters and Voltage-Level Categorization

### Task Breakdown:
1. Identify data sources for electrical job classifications and voltage levels
2. Update the UI to include filters for job classifications specific to the electrical industry

4. Test to ensure the filters and categorizations are working as expected

### Context Analysis:
Based on my review of the codebase:

1. **Current State:**
   - Jobs screen exists at `lib/screens/jobs/jobs_screen.dart`
   - Basic job model exists at `lib/models/job_model.dart` with classification field
   - Filter infrastructure exists with:
     - `lib/models/filter_criteria.dart` - filter model
     - `lib/providers/job_filter_provider.dart` - filter state management
   - Current filter options include basic types but not electrical-specific classifications

2. **Required Enhancements:**
   - Add electrical industry classifications (Journeyman Lineman, Journeyman Electrician, Journeyman Wireman, etc.)
   - Add voltage level categorization (Low Voltage, Medium Voltage, High Voltage, Extra High Voltage)
   - Update UI to display these filters
   - Ensure data models support these classifications

### Progress Tracking:
- [x] Task 1: Identify data sources - Electrical classifications and voltage levels defined
