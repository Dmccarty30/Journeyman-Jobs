description: A quick command to have the agent pick-up where it left off when  the error terminated the agent

Ignore all previous errors and terminations. Resume exactly where you left off in the last successful step. Use the most recent context, code, and task goal before the error occurred. Do not repeat completed work. Do not summarize — just continue seamlessly.
