## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Analysis

**Total Sequential Time:** 72-99 hours
**Total Parallel Time:** 24-33 hours
**Performance Improvement:** **3x - 3.3x faster**

**Resource Utilization:**
- **Peak Concurrency:** 7 agents (Wave 4)
- **Average Concurrency:** 4.5 agents
- **Total Agent-Hours:** 72-99 hours
- **Wall-Clock Time:** 24-33 hours

**Bottlenecks:**
1. Task 4.2 â†’ 4.3 sequential dependency (9-12 hours)
2. Task 1.1 complexity (8-12 hours single agent)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Path Analysis

**Longest Path:** Wave 8 (Session Grace Period) = 8-12 hours
**Blocking Dependencies:** Wave 3 â†’ Wave 6 (Firestore index before Suggested Jobs)

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- Run Waves 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 in parallel with Wave 3
- Parallelize Wave 4 and Wave 5 tasks
- Start Wave 8 early as it has no dependencies

## âœ… Validation Gates

After each wave:
1. **Syntax Validation:** Flutter analyze
2. **Type Checking:** Dart type system validation
3. **Linting:** Flutter lint rules
4. **Testing:** Widget tests for affected components
5. **Integration:** Build and run app
6. **Documentation:** Update TASK.md completion status

---

## ðŸ“‹ Task Status Tracking

- **Total Tasks:** 23
- **Completed:** 1 (Task 2.1: Dark Mode)
- **In Progress:** 0

## ðŸ”„ Execution Strategy

1. **Interactive Mode:** User approval gates between waves
2. **Evidence-Based:** Collect metrics and validation results
3. **Dependency Management:** Automated blocking/unblocking
4. **Error Recovery:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. **Progress Reporting:** Real-time status updates
