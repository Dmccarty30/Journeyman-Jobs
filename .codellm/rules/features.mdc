# Working on Features

- When working on features, any and all newly created files must be created and saved to that features directory.
- All screens related to that features are to be saved to {{Feature}}/screens... Not lib/screens. 

- The same applies to models, providers, widgets, services, etc. I want all files assocciated to a feature to be saved to that features directory.
