# MCP Server Priority Rule


## Core Directive


**ALWAYS prioritize MCP server tools before using training knowledge. Exhaust all available MCP resources before falling back to internal knowledge.**


## Implementation Rule


For every task, query, or request:


1. **Scan all available MCP servers** - Review complete MCP server inventory
2. **Identify relevant tools** - Match task requirements to available capabilities Â 
3. **Execute MCP tools first** - Use servers before accessing training data
4. **Combine results** - Integrate MCP outputs with minimal training knowledge
5. **Default to MCP** - When uncertain, choose MCP tools over internal knowledge


## Priority Hierarchy


1. **MCP Server Tools** (Primary)
2. **Live data/APIs** (Secondary)
3. **Training knowledge** (Last resort)


## Key Phrase


*"MCP first, knowledge last"*
