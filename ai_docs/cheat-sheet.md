# Claude Code Cheat Sheet

A comprehensive guide to setting up and using Claude Code efficiently with a keyboard-first workflow.

---

## 0. First Time Setup: Login

**IMPORTANT**: Before anything else, make sure you're logged in correctly to get the best experience.

### Login Instructions:

1. Open Claude Code in your terminal
2. You'll be prompted to log in
3. **Choose the authentication method attached to your Claude subscription plan** (not API)
   - If you have Claude Pro or Claude Max, use your Anthropic account login
   - This ensures you get the full benefits of your subscription plan
4. Verify you're logged in by running `/cost` - you should see your subscription info

**Why This Matters**: Logging in with your subscription plan (vs API) gives you better rate limits, access to the latest models, and no per-request costs if you have Claude Max.

## 1. Claude Code Setup

Configure Claude Code for an optimal development experience. Follow these setup steps in order.

### Step 1: Shift+Enter Support (Essential First Step)

The most important setup - enables submitting messages to Claude with `SHIFT + ENTER`.

**Setup Instructions:**

Run `/terminal-setup` in Claude Code, which will automatically configure your terminal settings.

**Manual Setup Alternative:**
1. Open Cursor/VS Code settings
2. Search for "Terminal > Integrated: Send Keybindings To Shell"
3. **Uncheck** this option

**Fallback**: If Shift+Enter isn't working, use `\ + ENTER` (backslash + enter) to submit messages.

**Why This Matters**: Keeps your hands on the keyboard for faster iterations with Claude.

### Step 2: Settings Customization

Customize Claude Code behavior through `.claude/settings.json` in your project root.

**Common Settings:**

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  "autoApprovalSettings": {
    "enabled": true,
    "patterns": [
      "Read(//Users/yourname/**)",
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(git log:*)"
    ]
  },
  "statusLine": {
    "enabled": true,
    "template": "{{model}} | {{tokens}}"
  }
}
```

**Key Settings to Know:**
- `model`: Choose which Claude model to use
- `autoApprovalSettings`: Auto-approve specific tool uses to speed up workflow
- `statusLine`: Show model and token usage in status bar
- `hooks`: Configure shell commands that run on events (see Step 4)

### Step 3: MCP Server Configuration

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers extend Claude Code with specialized capabilities.

**What MCP Servers Provide:**
- **Supabase**: Database operations, migrations, logs
- **Context7**: Up-to-date library documentation
- **Time**: Timezone conversions and current time
- **Custom servers**: Build your own integrations

**Setup via .mcp.json:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supabase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@supabase/mcp-server"]
    },
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@context7/mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**When to Use:**
- Working with databases → Supabase MCP
- Need latest library docs → Context7 MCP
- Custom workflows → Build your own MCP server

### Step 4: Hooks Configuration

Hooks run shell commands automatically in response to events.

**Common Hook: Noise When Claude Finishes**

Play a sound when Claude finishes responding (great for audio feedback).

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Pop.aiff"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Available Hooks:**
- `UserPromptSubmit`: Runs when you submit a message
- `Stop`: Runs when Claude stops/finishes responding
- `PreToolUse`: Runs before tool execution (with optional matcher)
- `PostToolUse`: Runs after tool execution (with optional matcher)
- `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd`: Runs at session lifecycle events
- `SubagentStop`: Runs when a subagent stops
- `PreCompact`: Runs before conversation compaction
- `Notification`: Runs on notification events

**Example: Validate Bash Commands Before Execution**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 /path/to/validator.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Example: Lint After Edits**

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "npm run lint"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Windows/Linux Alternative for Sounds:**
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "powershell -c (New-Object Media.SoundPlayer 'C:\\Windows\\Media\\Windows Ding.wav').PlaySync()"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 2. Editor Setup (Cursor/VS Code)

Master these shortcuts to keep your hands on the keyboard and navigate efficiently between editor, terminal, and Claude Code.

### Terminal Management

| Action | macOS | Windows/Linux | Custom Setup Required | Example Use |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Create Terminal in Editor Area | `CMD + SHIFT + C` | `CTRL + SHIFT + C` | ⚙️ Yes* | Open a new terminal as a tab in the editor (not bottom panel) |
| Rename Terminal | `CMD + SHIFT + R` | `CTRL + SHIFT + R` | ⚙️ Yes* | Label terminals by purpose (e.g., "dev server", "git", "tests") |
| Navigate Terminal Tabs | `CMD + SHIFT + [` / `]` | `CTRL + SHIFT + [` / `]` | ⚙️ Yes* | Switch between multiple terminal instances without using mouse |

**\*Note**: These shortcuts require custom keybinding setup in Cursor/VS Code. See [Custom Keybinding Setup](#custom-keybinding-setup) below.

### Custom Keybinding Setup

The terminal management shortcuts above require custom configuration in Cursor/VS Code.

**How to Set Up Custom Keybindings:**

1. Open Command Palette: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`
2. Type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)"
3. Add your custom keybindings to `keybindings.json`

**Example Keybindings:**

```json
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+c",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.newInActiveWorkspace",
    "args": { "location": "editor" }
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+r",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.rename"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+[",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusPrevious"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+shift+]",
    "command": "workbench.action.terminal.focusNext"
  }
]
```

**For Windows/Linux**: Replace `"cmd"` with `"ctrl"` in the keybindings above.

**Note**: These are example shortcuts - customize them to match your preferences! The video walkthrough will demonstrate the full setup process.

## 4. Development Workflows

Practical workflows for common development tasks.

### Quick Review of Changes

Here's a typical workflow for reviewing changes after working with Claude:

1. **Open Source Control** - `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + G`
   - Review all file changes Claude made
   - See git diff for each file

2. **Open File Explorer** - `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + E`
   - Navigate to specific files you want to check
   - Browse the project structure

3. **Close Sidebar** - `CMD/CTRL + B`
   - Hide file explorer when done to maximize screen space
   - Return focus to your code

This workflow keeps your hands on the keyboard and lets you efficiently review Claude's changes before committing.
