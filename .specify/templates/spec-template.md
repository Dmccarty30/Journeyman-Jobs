# Feature Specification: Crews

**Feature Branch**: `002-Crews`  
**Created**: 9-14-2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This feature provides a central hub of communication between users. Especially the user's who travel together. The ones that do travel together often do so because they can slightly tolerate each other but more importantly, they share the same job and work preferences. So, that means that they "Tramp" together, or travel. When one finds a plausible job, they will notify the othe guys about the job, then they all bid for it and most of the time get it because they onboard as an entire crew. Which employers like because they get along with each other, they are more dependable, etc. So this feature, 'Crews' is exactly that reflected through my app."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The user creates an account, provides important preference data during onboarding. After they finish setting up their profile and account they can navigate the primary entry point for this feature which will be a screen called the 'TailBoard' Which is a term unique to the trade which is our daily pre-job briefing, where we assess the hazards of a job. Here the user can create a crew and become the foreman, which is responsible for maintaing the crews job searches and preferences. Here they can search for user's they may know to invite to join the crew. There will be a community message board as well as a private crew message board. So the purpose of this feature is that when a job becomes available that meet the preset preferences that job is sent to that crew. if the crew likes it then they can all bid on it at once, or the foreman has the capability to submit each members bid for the job, increasing their chances of employment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** that this is already a real world practice only simplified, **When** several users whom are buddys join the app, **Then** it only makes since to implement this feature for increased chances of employment, provide a familiar social media vibe, as well as a significant marketing apperates by an existing user finding a good job and his buddy needs work too, he can text, email, his buddy a link to join and bid for the job at the same time. There is no way this feature doesnt provide for the app.
2. **Given** that available jobs are becoming harder and harder to obtain, **When** i join a group of my peers in the same situation, **Then** i can substantially increase my chances of gainful employment.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users become aggressive or detramental to another users reputation/chanses of empployment?
- How does system handle to many user's interacting with other users by means of the messageboard in the tailboard screen?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload avatars, profile photos, as well as other images to represent their home local
- **FR-002**: System MUST track and anaylyze each users job history, locals worked out of, and job preferences to prevent over booking or signing books with out the intent of taking a job which decreases the chanses someone else gets a job.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to be ananymous or be able to leave a crew and report negative behavors
- **FR-004**: System MUST store, evauluate, analyze, structure algorythims based of of users data and job preferences
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all security events and user reports.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via email/password, SSO, OAuth?
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for a length of 1 year. 

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Ticket Number**: It is the unique identifier of each member in the union. This is what identifys a users real world choices.
- **Job preferences**: This determins what jobs are filtered and suggested on the users home screen. This is the data that will group users together to form crews. This data represent the user interests and therfore what skills or training they may be interested in or may need. Which i could provide.
