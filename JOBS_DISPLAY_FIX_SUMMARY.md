# Jobs Display Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Issues Fixed

1. **Text Size Issues in Job Cards**
   - Job titles were too large for the card layout
   - Button text was getting cut off
   - Text was not properly formatted (showing raw data like "journeyman-lineman")

2. **Data Field Mismatch**
   - Firestore structure didn't match expected field names in the Job model
   - Job titles were embedded in document IDs
   - Hours field contained certifications instead of numeric hours
   - Classification field contained dates instead of job classifications

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Created Job Formatting Utility (`/lib/utils/job_formatting.dart`)
- `formatJobTitle()`: Converts "journeyman-lineman" to "Journeyman Lineman"
- `formatClassification()`: Handles date formats and proper capitalization
- `formatWage()`: Ensures consistent wage display
- `formatHours()`: Handles both numeric hours and certification strings
- `formatLocation()`: Proper location capitalization
- `truncateText()`: Prevents text overflow

#### 2. Updated Job Card Component (`/lib/design_system/components/job_card.dart`)
- Reduced text sizes (using `labelSmall` and `bodySmall` instead of `bodyMedium`)
- Added text overflow handling with ellipsis
- Replaced custom buttons with smaller, icon-based buttons
- Added company info display
- Fixed button layout to prevent text cutoff
- Now shows "Local: 111" format as shown in screenshots

#### 3. Fixed Job Model Data Mapping (`/lib/models/job_model.dart`)
- Added logic to extract job title from document ID (e.g., "1249-Journeyman_Lineman-Company")
- Handles `description` field for job descriptions
- Properly maps `localNumber` field
- Handles hours field that contains certifications
- Added fallback field mappings for various Firestore structures

#### 4. Updated Jobs Screen (`/lib/screens/jobs/jobs_screen.dart`)
- Applied formatting utility to all displayed fields
- Reduced font sizes for better fit
- Added proper text overflow handling

### Visual Improvements

**Before:**
- Large text causing overflow
- Raw data display ("journeyman-lineman")
- Buttons with cut-off text

**After:**
- Properly sized text that fits within cards
- Formatted display ("Journeyman Lineman")
- Compact buttons with icons
- Clean, professional appearance

### Files Modified
1. `/lib/utils/job_formatting.dart` (new file)
2. `/lib/design_system/components/job_card.dart`
3. `/lib/models/job_model.dart`
4. `/lib/screens/jobs/jobs_screen.dart`

### Testing Recommendations
1. Clear app cache and restart
2. Navigate to Home and Jobs screens
3. Verify job cards display properly formatted text
4. Check that all information fits within card boundaries
5. Test button interactions (Details and Apply)
6. Verify data from Firestore displays correctly

### Additional Notes
- The job data structure in Firestore appears to use the document ID to store job information
- Some fields like `hours` are being used for certifications rather than numeric hours
- Consider standardizing the Firestore structure for better consistency
