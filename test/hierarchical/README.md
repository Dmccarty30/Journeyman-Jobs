# Hierarchical Initialization Test Suite

## Overview

This test suite validates the hierarchical initialization system for Journeyman Jobs, which manages a 4-level data hierarchy: **Unions → Locals → Members → Jobs**.

## Architecture Summary

### Hierarchical Structure
```
Unions (Level 1)
    ↓
Locals (Level 2) - 797+ IBEW locals
    ↓
Members (Level 3)
    ↓
Jobs (Level 4) - Job postings and opportunities
```

### Key Components
- **FirestoreService**: Base data operations
- **ResilientFirestoreService**: Enhanced with retry logic and error handling
- **Riverpod Providers**: State management with dependency injection
- **Memory Management**: Bounded lists and caching for performance
- **Authentication Gate**: Security layer preventing unauthorized access

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
- Service layer functionality
- Memory management components
- State management providers
- Error handling mechanisms

### 2. Widget Tests
- Initialization flows
- Loading states
- Error states
- Hierarchical data binding

### 3. Integration Tests
- End-to-end hierarchical flows
- Firebase integration
- Authentication integration
- Performance under load

### 4. Performance Tests
- Large dataset handling (797+ locals)
- Memory usage validation
- Loading time benchmarks
- Concurrent operation stress testing

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all hierarchical tests
flutter test test/hierarchical/

# Run specific test categories
flutter test test/hierarchical/unit/
flutter test test/hierarchical/widget/
flutter test test/hierarchical/integration/
flutter test test/hierarchical/performance/

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage test/hierarchical/
```

## Test Data

See `test/hierarchical/fixtures/` for mock data including:
- Union hierarchy mock data
- Local union records (797+ entries)
- Member profiles
- Job postings
- Error scenarios

## Quality Gates

- **Coverage**: ≥90% for hierarchical components
- **Performance**: <2s initial load, <500ms pagination
- **Memory**: <55MB during normal operation
- **Error Handling**: 100% error scenario coverage
