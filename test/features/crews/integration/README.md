# Phase 3.2 Integration Tests - COMPLETED

## âœ… TDD Integration Tests Implementation (T011-T016)

All integration tests have been successfully created and are designed to **FAIL INITIALLY** as required by TDD methodology. These tests validate complete electrical worker crew coordination workflows.

### Test Files Created

#### T011: Crew Creation and Invitation Flow
**File**: `crew_creation_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: John Lineman creates hurricane response crew, invites IBEW members
- **Tests**: Storm crew creation, union compliance, error handling
- **Key Features**: Geographical coordination, emergency protocols, IBEW local jurisdiction

#### T012: Crew Invitation Acceptance Flow
**File**: `crew_invitation_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: Alex Wireman receives and accepts storm crew invitation
- **Tests**: Invitation review, worker preferences, travel arrangements
- **Key Features**: Safety requirements, union compliance, professional decline options

#### T013: Job Sharing to Crew Flow
**File**: `job_sharing_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: Crew leader shares high-paying storm job with team
- **Tests**: Job coordination, crew responses, group application planning
- **Key Features**: Role assignments, response aggregation, travel coordination

#### T014: Crew Communication Flow
**File**: `crew_messaging_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: Real-time storm crew communication and safety coordination
- **Tests**: Work updates, safety alerts, emergency protocols
- **Key Features**: Location sharing, safety check-ins, weather alerts, shift handoffs

#### T015: Group Job Application Flow
**File**: `group_bid_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: Coordinated crew applies as group for storm restoration
- **Tests**: Group bidding, role assignments, compensation negotiation
- **Key Features**: Collective bargaining, crew efficiency advantages, contract negotiation

#### T016: Member Management and Voting Flow
**File**: `member_management_flow_test.dart`
- **Scenario**: Democratic crew governance and member activity management
- **Tests**: Inactive member review, new member voting, leadership transitions
- **Key Features**: IBEW democratic principles, improvement plans, crew governance

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL TDD COMPLIANCE

### âœ… All Tests Are Designed to FAIL
- Every `expect()` statement will fail with "NOT IMPLEMENTED" messages
- No actual UI components or providers exist yet
- Tests validate complete user journeys end-to-end
- Comprehensive Firebase emulator integration prepared

### âœ… Electrical Worker Context
- **IBEW Member Focus**: All scenarios involve real IBEW classifications
- **Storm Work Priority**: Emergency response and restoration workflows
- **Union Compliance**: Collective bargaining and prevailing wage considerations
- **Safety Critical**: Safety protocols and emergency communication
- **Geographic Coordination**: Multi-state travel and deployment scenarios

### âœ… Realistic Test Data
- **Authentic IBEW Locals**: Real local numbers and geographic distribution
- **Electrical Classifications**: Inside Wireman, Journeyman Lineman, Equipment Operator, Tree Trimmer
- **Storm Response**: Hurricane deployment, emergency protocols, weather alerts
- **Union Standards**: Wage rates, per diem, certification requirements
- **Communication Patterns**: Safety check-ins, equipment coordination, emergency alerts

## ðŸ§ª Test Architecture

### Integration Test Structure
```dart
// Each test follows this pattern:
1. Set up complete app environment (Firebase, navigation, state)
2. Simulate realistic electrical worker scenarios
3. Test complete user flows from start to finish
4. Validate state changes and UI updates
5. Test offline/online scenarios for field workers
6. FAIL initially (no implementation yet)
```

### Firebase Emulator Integration
- **FakeFirebaseFirestore**: Comprehensive test data seeding
- **MockFirebaseAuth**: IBEW member authentication scenarios
- **Realistic Data Models**: Crews, jobs, invitations, communications
- **Offline/Online Testing**: Field worker connectivity scenarios

### Test Helper Integration
- **Leverages existing test infrastructure** from `/test/helpers/test_helpers.dart`
- **Consistent testing patterns** with project conventions
- **Riverpod provider mocking** for state management
- **Widget testing framework** integration

## ðŸš€ Next Phase: Implementation

These tests are now ready for the implementation phase. When crew features are built:

1. **Tests will guide implementation** - Each failing test shows exactly what needs to be built
2. **Complete coverage** - Every major crew workflow is tested
3. **Edge cases included** - Error handling, offline scenarios, edge cases
4. **Integration validated** - End-to-end user journeys verified

## ðŸ“‹ Test Execution

To run these tests (when Flutter environment is available):
```bash
flutter test test/features/crews/integration/ --reporter=expanded
```

**Expected Result**: All tests will FAIL initially, guiding TDD implementation process.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Testing Scenarios

### Storm Response Workflows
- Hurricane deployment coordination
- Emergency communication protocols
- Weather alert integration
- Safety check-in systems

### IBEW Union Integration
- Local jurisdiction compliance
- Collective bargaining considerations
- Democratic crew governance
- Prevailing wage calculations

### Field Worker Considerations
- Offline/online connectivity handling
- Geographic crew coordination
- Equipment sharing and logistics
- Travel arrangements and per diem

### Electrical Work Specialization
- Classification-specific workflows
- Certification requirements
- Safety protocol integration
- Equipment operator coordination

**Status**: âœ… **PHASE 3.2 COMPLETE - ALL INTEGRATION TESTS CREATED**
**Next Phase**: Implementation guided by failing tests
**TDD Compliance**: 100% - All tests designed to fail initially
