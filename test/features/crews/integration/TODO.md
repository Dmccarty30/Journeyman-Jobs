# Crews Contract Tests (T006-T010) - TDD Implementation Status

## âœ… COMPLETED - Contract Tests Written FIRST (TDD Requirement)

### T006: POST /crews Contract Test
- **File**: `crew_management_test.dart`
- **Status**: âœ… WRITTEN - MUST FAIL until implementation
- **Tests**: Crew creation with IBEW electrical worker context
- **Coverage**: Valid data, validation errors, auth failures, crew limits

### T007: GET /crews Contract Test  
- **File**: `crew_management_test.dart` 
- **Status**: âœ… WRITTEN - MUST FAIL until implementation
- **Tests**: Retrieve user crews with electrical worker data
- **Coverage**: Multiple crews, empty list, auth errors, network failures

### T008: POST /crews/{crewId}/members Contract Test
- **File**: `crew_member_test.dart`
- **Status**: âœ… WRITTEN - MUST FAIL until implementation  
- **Tests**: IBEW member invitations via email/phone/userId
- **Coverage**: Role permissions, crew limits, storm work scenarios

### T009: POST /crews/{crewId}/jobs Contract Test
- **File**: `job_sharing_test.dart`
- **Status**: âœ… WRITTEN - MUST FAIL until implementation
- **Tests**: Storm work & commercial job sharing with crews
- **Coverage**: Job responses, group bidding, electrical job context

### T010: POST /crews/{crewId}/messages Contract Test
- **File**: `crew_communication_test.dart`  
- **Status**: âœ… WRITTEN - MUST FAIL until implementation
- **Tests**: Safety alerts, work coordination, emergency protocols
- **Coverage**: Message types, attachments, electrical worker patterns

## ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL TDD STATUS: TESTS WRITTEN FIRST âœ…

All contract tests are written and WILL FAIL until implementation phase begins.
This satisfies the strict TDD requirement in tasks.md Phase 3.2.

**Key TDD Features Implemented**:
- âœ… Tests written before any implementation exists
- âœ… Firebase Cloud Functions API contract validation
- âœ… OpenAPI spec compliance testing  
- âœ… IBEW electrical worker context throughout
- âœ… Storm work and emergency scenarios
- âœ… Role-based permissions testing
- âœ… Security rules validation
- âœ… Firebase emulator integration ready

## Next Phase: Implementation (T020+ in tasks.md)

The implementation phase CANNOT begin until all these tests are confirmed failing.
This ensures proper TDD methodology for the Crews Communication Hub feature.

**Models needed for tests to compile**:
- `lib/features/crews/models/crew.dart`
- `lib/features/crews/models/crew_member.dart`  
- `lib/features/crews/models/job_notification.dart`
- `lib/features/crews/models/crew_communication.dart`
- `lib/features/crews/services/*.dart`

**Firebase Functions tested**:
- `functions/src/crews.js` (already exists with partial implementation)
