## Multi-Agent Coordination Matrix

### Phase Dependencies Analysis

**Critical Cross-Phase Dependencies:**
- **Phase 7 (Crew System) → Phases 8-10 (Social Features)**: Crew membership validation for Feed/Chat access
- **Phase 3-6 (Screen Improvements) → All Phases**: Theme consistency requirements
- **Phase 11 (Search Fixes) → Phase 5 (Jobs Screen)**: Search functionality patterns
- **Phase 12-13 (Profile/Resources) → Phase 4 (Home Screen)**: Navigation and user data consistency

### Agent Specialization & File Ownership

**File Conflict Prevention Matrix:**
```yaml
High-Risk Shared Files:
  - lib/design_system/app_theme.dart: All agents must coordinate
  - lib/navigation/app_router.dart: Phases 8-10 adding new routes
  - lib/screens/nav_bar_page.dart: Phase 8 Feed tab integration
  - lib/electrical_components/*.dart: Theme consistency validation

Agent Coordination Rules:
  - flutter-expert (primary): Screen implementations, UI fixes
  - ui-ux-designer: Theme consistency, electrical component integration
  - security-auditor: Phase 7.10 Firestore rules, permission validation

```

### Component Integration Framework

**Electrical Theme Consistency Requirements:**
- All new components must use `AppTheme.accentCopper` and `AppTheme.primaryNavy`
- Circuit background pattern integration: `ElectricalCircuitBackground` component
- Custom switches: Use `JJCircuitBreakerSwitch` instead of standard Flutter switches
- Animation consistency: Follow `AppTheme.durationElectrical*` timing constants
