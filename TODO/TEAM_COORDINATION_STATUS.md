## ðŸ”„ Coordination Protocols

### File Conflict Prevention
- Each agent assigned to distinct phase with minimal file overlap
- Shared files (`app_theme.dart`, navigation) require coordination
- Priority: First agent to modify wins, others adapt

### Quality Gates
- All changes must maintain electrical theme consistency
- Firebase integration must follow existing patterns
- Widget tests required for new components
- Update TODO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with [x] checkboxes

### Cross-Phase Dependencies
- **Theme Changes**: Must coordinate with all UI agents
- **Navigation Updates**: Affect multiple screens
- **User Data**: Profile changes affect multiple features

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

### Completion Metrics
- **Total Tasks**: 38 remaining
- **Parallel Tasks [P]**: 28 tasks can run simultaneously
- **Critical Dependencies**: 4 tasks require coordination
- **Estimated Completion**: 2-3 hours with parallel execution

### Quality Standards
- âœ… Electrical theme consistency maintained
- âœ… Firebase patterns followed
- âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality
- âœ… All files saved to TODO\ directory as requested

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Shared Theme Files**: Multiple agents may modify `app_theme.dart`
2. **Navigation Changes**: Could affect multiple screens
3. **Firebase Rules**: Permission changes require careful testing
4. **State Management**: Provider updates need coordination

### Mitigation Strategies
- Monitor file modifications in real-time
- Coordinate theme changes through single source
- Test Firebase operations before deployment
- Validate state management changes across features
