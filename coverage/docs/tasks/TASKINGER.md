## Task-Orchestrator Command Instructions

### üéÆ Execution Commands

To execute this comprehensive task orchestration plan:

1. **Initialize Task-Orchestrator**:

   ```bash
   /task-orchestrator --init --plan TASKINGER.md
   ```

2. **Execute Phase 1 (Critical)**:

   ```bash
   /task-orchestrator --execute --phase critical --parallel
   ```

3. **Execute All Phases**:

   ```bash
   /task-orchestrator --execute --all --parallel --validate
   ```

4. **Monitor Progress**:

   ```bash
   /task-orchestrator --status --detailed
   ```

### üìã Progress Tracking

Each task includes specific validation criteria and success metrics. The task-orchestrator will:

- Track completion status across all 68 subtasks
- Validate dependencies before allowing parallel execution
- Generate progress reports with completion percentages
- Coordinate agent handoffs between dependent tasks
- Ensure quality gates are met before phase transitions

### üîç Quality Assurance

The task-orchestrator implements comprehensive quality control:

- **Pre-Execution Validation**: Verify all prerequisites are met
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Track progress and agent performance
- **Post-Execution Verification**: Validate all completion criteria
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure changes work together seamlessly
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintain updated technical documentation
