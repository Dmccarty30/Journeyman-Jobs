## üÜò Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue: Invite code validation fails**

- Check code format matches `^[A-Z0-9-]+-\d{2}/\d{2}-\d{3}$`
- Verify code exists in Firestore
- Check code hasn't expired (>7 days old)
- Verify code hasn't been used

**Issue: User can't join crew**

- Check user isn't already a member
- Verify user has < 3 crew memberships
- Verify crew has < 10 members
- Check crew is still active

**Issue: Join request not appearing**

- Verify user is authenticated
- Check Firestore security rules
- Verify crew is public
- Check for pending request already exists

**Issue: Search not returning results**

- Verify Firestore indexes are created
- Check visibility filter (public only)
- Verify crews exist with matching criteria
- Check isActive filter

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Review** the [technical specification](./CREW_JOINING_SPECIFICATION.md)
2. **Schedule** sprint planning meeting
3. **Assign** tasks to developers
4. **Set up** development environment
5. **Create** Firestore indexes
6. **Start** with Phase 1 (Invite Code System)

## üìù Notes

- All critical fixes have been implemented ‚úÖ
- Member limit: 10 per crew ‚úÖ
- User limit: 3 crews per user ‚úÖ
