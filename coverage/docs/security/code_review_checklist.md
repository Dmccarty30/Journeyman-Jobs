## üîç Security Review Process

### Pre-Review Checklist
1. **Automated Security Scan**
   - Run security audit tool: `dart tools/security_audit_report.dart`
   - Verify 100% security score
   - Address any critical issues found

2. **Manual Code Review**
   - Review all authentication logic
   - Check data encryption implementations
   - Verify input validation coverage
   - Examine error handling paths

3. **Dependency Review**
   - Check for vulnerable dependencies
   - Verify license compliance
   - Review third-party security practices

### Review Questions

#### Data Protection
- Are all sensitive user data encrypted?
- Is PII properly redacted in logs?
- Are encryption keys securely managed?
- Is data transmission secure?

#### Authentication
- Is authentication properly implemented?
- Are sessions securely managed?
- Is authorization properly enforced?
- Are tokens properly validated?

#### Input Validation
- Are all user inputs validated?
- Is there protection against injection attacks?
- Are file uploads properly validated?
- Is API input validation comprehensive?

#### Error Handling
- Do error messages expose sensitive information?
- Are errors logged securely?
- Is there proper exception handling?
- Are security events properly logged?

## üö® Security Issue Classification
