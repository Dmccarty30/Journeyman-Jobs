**Impact**: Resolves startup deadlocks and memory leaks

#### DEP-2: Theme System Dependency Conflicts (High)
**File**: `lib/design_system/tailboard_theme.dart`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
- Updated TailboardTheme to delegate to AppTheme for core methods
- Added proper import for AppTheme dependency
- Implemented consistent theming across systems
- Eliminated conflicting theme dependencies

**Impact**: Ensures consistent UI across all screens

#### DEP-3: Firebase Service Dependencies (High)
**File**: `lib/services/database_performance_monitor.dart`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
- Added Firebase initialization checks before attempting database operations
- Implemented proper service initialization sequencing

- Enhanced error handling for Firebase-specific issues

**Impact**: Prevents app crashes during startup when Firebase is not ready

#### DEP-4: Provider System Dependencies (Medium)
**File**: `lib/providers/riverpod/hierarchical_riverpod_provider.dart`
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
- Refactored provider dependencies to eliminate circular references
- Removed dependency injection in constructor to break dependency chains
- Implemented asynchronous initialization where needed
- Added proper disposal management

**Impact**: Fixes system initialization failures

#### DEP-5: Service Layer Dependencies (Medium)
**File**: `lib/services/service_lifecycle_manager.dart` (NEW)
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Changes Made**:
- Created comprehensive service lifecycle management system
- Implemented dependency-aware service initialization
- Added graceful degradation when services fail
- Implemented topological sorting for dependency resolution
- Added service health monitoring and error isolation

**Impact**: Prevents memory leaks and initialization race conditions

## Integration Verification

### System Tests Passed ✅
1. **Firebase Initialization**: Proper sequencing with error handling
2. **Theme System**: All utility methods working correctly
3. **Build Generation**: Code generation completes successfully
4. **Error Handling**: System recovers from initialization failures
5. **Dependency Resolution**: No circular dependencies detected
6. **Service Lifecycle**: Services initialize in proper order

### Performance Improvements ✅
- **Startup Time**: Reduced from potential deadlocks to graceful initialization
- **Memory Usage**: Eliminated memory leaks from circular dependencies
- **Error Recovery**: System continues operating when non-critical services fail
- **Build Time**: Faster builds due to fixed code generation

### Error Handling Enhancements ✅
- **Firebase Errors**: Automatic offline mode when Firebase unavailable
- **Service Failures**: Graceful degradation with fallback functionality
- **Timeout Handling**: Increased timeouts and retry mechanisms
- **Error Isolation**: Failed services don't cascade to other components
