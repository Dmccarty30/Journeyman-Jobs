# Error Detective Analysis Report
## Root Cause Analysis - 2025-10-29

### Initial Assessment
Based on git status analysis, there are multiple modified files across the hierarchical initialization system, providers, and services. This pattern suggests a systemic issue rather than isolated problems.

### Files Requiring Investigation
- lib/main.dart (M)
- lib/models/hierarchical/ (multiple modified files)
- lib/providers/riverpod/optimized_auth_riverpod_provider.dart (M)
- lib/services/database_performance_monitor.dart (M)
- lib/services/hierarchical/ (multiple modified files)

### Analysis Approach
1. Examine initialization flow and dependencies
2. Check for circular dependencies in provider chain
3. Analyze error handling patterns in hierarchical system
4. Review performance monitoring integration
