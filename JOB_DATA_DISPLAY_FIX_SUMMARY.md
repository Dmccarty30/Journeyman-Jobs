# Job Data Display Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Issue
Job cards were not displaying all available data correctly, while the detail popup showed everything properly. The data was present but not being extracted and displayed consistently.

### Problems Identified

1. **Job Title Display**
   - Cards showed raw data like "journeyman-lineman"
   - Popup showed formatted "Journeyman Lineman"

2. **Missing Data on Cards**
   - Start date was available but not shown
   - Hours field contained certifications but was treated as numeric
   - Job class/title wasn't being checked properly
   - Local number had multiple possible field names

3. **Data Field Confusion**
   - `hours` field sometimes contains certifications like "CDL, fa/cpr"
   - `jobTitle` vs `jobClass` vs `classification` confusion
   - `local` vs `localNumber` field names

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Job Title Display Logic
- Updated to check multiple fields: `jobTitle` ?? `jobClass` ?? `classification`
- Applied `JobFormatting.formatJobTitle()` for consistent display
- Fixed both job cards and detail popups

#### 2. Smart Hours Field Handling
- Detects when hours field contains certifications (comma-separated values)
- Shows certifications as requirements on job card when detected
- Defaults to "40hrs" when hours field contains non-numeric data
- Detail popup properly handles both numeric hours and certification strings

#### 3. Added Missing Data to Job Cards
- **Start Date**: Now displayed with calendar icon when available
- **Certifications**: Shown in yellow badge when found in hours field
- **Local Number**: Checks both `local` and `localNumber` fields

#### 4. Consistent Data Display
- Jobs Screen cards now show:
  - Properly formatted job title
  - Local number (checking multiple fields)
  - Company and location
  - Wage (or "Competitive" if not set)
  - Hours (or certifications if that's what's in the field)
  - Per diem if available
  - Start date if available
  - Certifications/requirements badge

- Home Screen cards updated similarly with:
  - Formatted job title
  - Proper local number display
  - Start date when available
  - Consistent formatting

### Files Modified
1. `/lib/screens/jobs/jobs_screen.dart`
   - Updated job card display logic
   - Enhanced detail popup formatting
   - Added certification detection and display

2. `/lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart`
   - Applied job formatting utility
   - Added start date display
   - Fixed local number display

3. `/lib/models/job_model.dart` (previously updated)
   - Enhanced field mapping logic
   - Added fallback field checking

### Visual Improvements

**Before:**
- Raw job titles like "journeyman-lineman"
- Missing start dates and certifications
- Inconsistent data display between card and popup

**After:**
- Formatted titles like "Journeyman Lineman"
- Start dates shown with calendar icon
- Certifications displayed in yellow badge
- Consistent data between cards and popups

### Special Handling

1. **Certifications in Hours Field**
   - When hours contains commas, it's treated as certifications
   - Displayed in a special "Requires:" badge on cards
   - Shown in Qualifications section in detail popup

2. **Fallback Values**
   - Hours defaults to "40hrs" when non-numeric
   - Wage shows "Competitive" when not set
   - Local shows "N/A" when not available

### Testing Recommendations
1. Verify job cards show all available data
2. Check that certifications appear when hours field contains them
3. Confirm start dates display correctly
4. Ensure job titles are properly formatted
5. Test that popup details match card information
