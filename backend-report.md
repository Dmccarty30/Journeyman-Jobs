2. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with multiple providers
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation in models
4. **Secure Storage**: Encrypted local storage for sensitive data

#### Security Gaps
1. **Firestore Rules**: Development mode rules in production
2. **API Security**: No rate limiting or API key management
3. **Data Validation**: Limited server-side validation
4. **Access Control**: No role-based permissions

### 6.2 Recommended Security Enhancements

#### IMMEDIATE (Before Production)
1. **Implement Production Security Rules**
```javascript
// Example production rules structure
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Job access control
    match /jobs/{jobId} {
      allow read: if isAuthenticated();
      allow write: if isJobOwner(jobId) || isAdmin();
    }

    // Crew membership validation
    match /crews/{crewId} {
      allow read: if isCrewMember(crewId);
      allow write: if isCrewForeman(crewId);
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Add Data Validation Rules**
```javascript
// Job posting validation
match /jobs/{jobId} {
  allow create: if isValidJobPosting();
  allow update: if isValidJobUpdate();
}

function isValidJobPosting() {
  return request.resource.data.keys().hasAll(['company', 'location', 'timestamp']) &&
         request.resource.data.company is string &&
         request.resource.data.company.size() > 0;
}
```
