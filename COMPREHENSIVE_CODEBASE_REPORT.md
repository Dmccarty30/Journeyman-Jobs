## Integration Dependencies for Phases 1-2

### Authentication Flow Integration
- `auth_service.dart` → `auth_screen.dart` → `onboarding_steps_screen.dart` → `firestore_service.dart`
- All agents must coordinate on API modernization patterns
- Security rules must align with new authentication patterns

### Theme System Dependencies  
- `app_theme.dart` → `reusable_components.dart` → All UI screens
- Design consistency must be maintained across all changes
- Electrical theming is core to app identity

### Data Flow Dependencies
- `firestore_service.dart` → All data-dependent screens
- Security rules must support all service operations
- Performance optimizations affect entire app experience

## Agent Coordination Recommendations

### Phase 1 Critical Path
1. **auth-expert**: Fix Google Sign-In API first - blocks other auth work
2. **security-auditor**: Implement security rules based on updated auth patterns
3. **flutter-expert**: Update UI components after auth changes
4. **backend-architect**: Coordinate database optimizations

### Phase 2 Coordination Points
1. Legacy code removal must be coordinated across all agents
2. Performance optimizations should be implemented incrementally
3. Theme updates require cross-agent verification
4. Database changes need security rule updates

### Success Criteria
- All authentication flows working with modern APIs
- No security vulnerabilities in Firebase rules
- Performance improvements measurable
- Electrical theming maintained throughout
- Code reduction achieved without breaking functionality

This analysis provides the foundation for coordinated Phase 1-2 implementation across all specialized agents.
