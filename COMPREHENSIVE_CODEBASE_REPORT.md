## Security Vulnerability Details

### Critical: Development Mode Security Rules
**Risk Level:** PRODUCTION CRITICAL
**Files:** `firebase/firestore.rules`
**Impact:** Any authenticated user can access all data regardless of role or ownership
**Solution:** Implement production-ready rules with:
- User-owned data access only
- Role-based crew management
- Field-level update restrictions
- Data validation rules

### High: Missing Role Enforcement
**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Files:** Security rules, crew models
**Impact:** RBAC system exists in code but not enforced in database
**Solution:** Implement security rule functions:
- `isCrewMember(userId, crewId)`
- `hasCrewRole(userId, crewId, roles)`
- `isJobOwner(jobId)`
- `isValidCrewUpdate()`

### Medium: User Data Exposure
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Files:** User model, queries
**Impact:** Sensitive IBEW worker information accessible to all users
**Solution:** Add field-level security:
- PII encryption at rest
- Consent-based data sharing
- Privacy dashboard implementation

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Security Rules Implementation
```javascript
// Production-ready rule structure
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    function isAuthenticated() {
      return request.auth != null && request.auth.token.email_verified == true;
    }

    function isCrewMember(userId, crewId) {
      return exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/crews/$(crewId)/members/$(userId));
    }

    function hasCrewRole(userId, crewId, roles) {
      return isCrewMember(userId, crewId) &&
             roles.contains(get(/databases/$(database)/documents/crews/$(crewId)/members/$(userId)).data.role);
    }

    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if isAuthenticated() && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Crew-based access control
    match /crews/{crewId} {
      allow read: if isCrewMember(request.auth.uid, crewId);
      allow write: if hasCrewRole(request.auth.uid, crewId, ['foreman', 'admin']);
    }
  }
}
```

### Index Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy optimized indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Verify deployment
firebase firestore:indexes list
```

### Service Refactoring Pattern
```dart
// Before: Large monolithic service
class FirestoreService {
  // 500+ lines with multiple responsibilities
}

// After: Focused microservices
class JobQueryService {
  // Query operations only
}

class JobMutationService {
  // Create/update/delete operations only
}

class JobCacheService {
  // Cache management only
}
```
