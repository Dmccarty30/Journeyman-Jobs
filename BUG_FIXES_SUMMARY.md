# Bug Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Critical Bugs Fixed

1. **Null Safety Violation** - `/lib/widgets/optimized_selector_widgets.dart:151`
   - **Issue**: Using `user!.uid` in hashCode without null check would crash if user is null
   - **Fix**: Changed to `(user?.uid.hashCode ?? 0)` to handle null safely

2. **Sensitive Error Exposure** - Multiple files
   - **Files**: 
     - `/lib/widgets/popups/firestore_query_popup.dart` (lines 244, 286)
     - `/lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart` (lines 116, 206, 225, 275, 341, 421, 465)
   - **Issue**: Raw error messages exposed to users via `e.toString()`
   - **Fix**: Created `ErrorSanitizer` utility class and replaced all raw error exposures with sanitized messages

### Medium Priority Bugs Fixed

3. **Missing await on Future** - `/lib/screens/settings/support/calculators/voltage_drop_calculator.dart:44`
   - **Issue**: `Future.delayed` not awaited, causing potential race conditions
   - **Fix**: Made method async and added await to properly handle the delay

4. **Unbounded Cache Growth** - `/lib/services/search_analytics_service.dart:188`
   - **Issue**: `_searchTrends` map grows without limit, causing memory leaks
   - **Fix**: Added LRU eviction with max size of 500 entries

5. **Race Condition** - `/lib/utils/concurrent_operations.dart:348`
   - **Issue**: Check-then-act pattern on `_resourceLocks` could cause null reference
   - **Fix**: Use local reference and proper null checking with timeout handling

6. **Form State Null Access** - `/lib/screens/settings/support/calculators/voltage_drop_calculator.dart`
   - **Issue**: Using `_formKey.currentState!` without null check
   - **Fix**: Changed to `_formKey.currentState?.validate() == true` pattern

### Low Priority Bugs Fixed

7. **Error Context Loss** - `/lib/services/usage_report_service.dart`
   - **Issue**: Stack traces lost when catching errors
   - **Fix**: Added stack trace capture and logging while sanitizing user-facing messages

8. **Unsafe Type Casting** - `/lib/legacy/flutterflow/schema/firestore_util.dart:21-23`
   - **Issue**: Casting null parse results to non-nullable types would fail
   - **Fix**: Added proper null checks before casting

## Impact Summary

- **Crash Prevention**: Fixed null safety violation that would have caused app crashes
- **Security Enhancement**: Prevented sensitive error information from being exposed to users
- **Memory Management**: Added bounds to prevent unbounded memory growth
- **Stability**: Fixed race conditions and improper async handling
- **Code Quality**: Improved error handling with proper context preservation

## Testing Recommendation

Since Flutter/Dart runtime is not available in the current environment, it's recommended to:
1. Run the full test suite locally: `flutter test`
2. Pay special attention to:
   - Auth state tests (null user handling)
   - Error display tests (verify sanitized messages)
   - Memory usage tests (verify cache bounds)
   - Concurrent operation tests (verify no race conditions)
