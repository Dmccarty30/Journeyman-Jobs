# Locals Screen Fix Summary

## Date: 2025-07-19

### Issue
The locals screen was not rendering data from Firestore because of a field name mismatch between the Firestore database structure and the LocalsRecord model being used.

### Root Cause
The app was using a LocalsRecord model that expected different field names than what exists in Firestore:

**Firestore Fields (Actual):**
- `local_union` (e.g., "1")
- `city` (e.g., "St. Louis")
- `state` (e.g., "MO")
- `email` (e.g., "office@ibewlocal1.org")
- `phone` (e.g., "(573) 334-2471")
- `address` (e.g., "2611 Gerhardt Street Cape Girardeau, MO 63703")
- `classification` (e.g., "as, c, ees, ei, em, es, et, fm, i, mt, ptc, rts, s, se, spa, st, ws")
- `business_manager`, `financial_secretary`, `president`, `recording_secretary`
- `fax`, `website`, `meeting_schedule`

**LocalsRecord Model Expected (Wrong):**
- `localNumber` (should be `local_union`)
- `localName` (doesn't exist in Firestore)
- `location` (should be constructed from `city` and `state`)
- `contactEmail` (should be `email`)
- `contactPhone` (should be `phone`)
- `memberCount` (should be `member_count` if exists)
- `specialties` (doesn't exist in Firestore)
- `isActive` (should be `is_active` if exists)
- `createdAt` (should be `created_at` if exists)
- `updatedAt` (should be `updated_at` if exists)

### Fix Applied
Updated the LocalsRecord creation in `app_state_provider.dart` to correctly map Firestore fields:

1. **In `loadLocals` method** (lines 388-413):
   - Map `local_union` to `localNumber`
   - Generate `localName` if not present
   - Construct `location` from `city` and `state`
   - Map `email` to `contactEmail`
   - Map `phone` to `contactPhone`
   - Handle missing fields with defaults

2. **In `loadMoreLocals` method** (lines 456-481):
   - Applied the same field mapping for consistency

### Files Modified
- `/lib/providers/app_state_provider.dart`

### What This Fixes
- Locals will now properly load from Firestore and display in the UI
- All local union information will be correctly mapped and displayed
- Contact information (phone, email, website) will work properly
- Address and location data will display correctly

### Testing Recommendation
1. Clear app data/cache to ensure fresh load
2. Navigate to the Locals screen
3. Verify that locals are displayed with correct information
4. Test search functionality
5. Test contact actions (phone, email, website links)
6. Test "Load More" pagination

### Additional Notes
- The legacy LocalsRecord model in `/lib/legacy/flutterflow/schema/locals_record.dart` actually matches the Firestore structure correctly, but the app is using the newer model in `/lib/models/locals_record.dart`
- Consider either updating the Firestore structure to match the new model or updating the new model to match the Firestore structure for long-term consistency
