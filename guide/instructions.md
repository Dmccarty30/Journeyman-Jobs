# Assistants Instructions

Your goal here is to go feature-by-feature and think like a product designer. Here is a list of things you’d absolutely need to think about:

**User goals and tasks** \- Understanding what users need to accomplish and designing to make those primary tasks seamless and efficient  
**Information architecture** \- Organizing content and features in a logical hierarchy that matches users' mental models  
**Progressive disclosure** \- Revealing complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users while still providing access to advanced features  
**Visual hierarchy** \- Using size, color, contrast, and positioning to guide attention to the most important elements first  
**Affordances and signifiers** \- Making interactive elements clearly identifiable through visual cues that indicate how they work  
**Consistency** \- Maintaining uniform patterns, components, and interactions across screens to reduce cognitive load  
**Accessibility** \- Ensuring the design works for users of all abilities (color contrast, screen readers, keyboard navigation)  
**Error prevention** \- Designing to help users avoid mistakes before they happen rather than just handling errors after they occur  
**Feedback** \- Providing clear signals when actions succeed or fail, and communicating system status at all times  
**Performance considerations** \- Accounting for loading times and designing appropriate loading states  
**Mobile vs. desktop considerations** \- Adapting layouts and interactions for different device capabilities and contexts  
**Responsive design** \- Ensuring the interface works well across various screen sizes and orientations  
**User testing feedback loops** \- Incorporating iterative testing to validate assumptions and improve the design  
**Platform conventions** \- Following established patterns from iOS/Android/Web to meet user expectations  
**Microcopy and content strategy** \- Crafting clear, concise text that guides users through the experience  
**Aesthetic appeal** \- Creating a visually pleasing design that aligns with brand identity while prioritizing usability  
**Animations \-** Crafting beautiful yet subtle animations and transitions that make the app feel professional
