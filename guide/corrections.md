# UI Corrections

## Onboarding Screens

### Step 1

okay now i need for you to condense it from 8 steps to 3 maybe 4. I dont want the user to lose interest the very first time they use the app. Step one basic info name address stuff, second step who they are as an ibew journeyman, their ticket number, home local, classification, if they are working, what books are they already on (this is important because this will tell me what i will have to do to resign for them each month to maintain their position and chances to get a job)

### Step 2

This is where the user gives their preferences. hat construction type they prefer (choice chips), The amount of hours they are willing to work each week(Drop-down), the amount of per diem they are looking for(Drop-down), what locals do they prefere to work out of(text feild),  networkWithOthers, careerAdvancements, betterBenefits, higherPayRate, learnNewSkill, travelToNewLocation, findLongTermWork,(bool)

### Step 3

last step, i that is where i want to hear from the user. How did they hear about us, what are they looking to accomplish by using the app, and so on. make them feel like they have a voice and a say in the matter. which they do. careerGoals, aboutUs, lookingToAccomplish(string)

***Once the user completes onboarding they navigate to the home screen, change the state so that they navigate to the home screen everytime they sign in,and updates the user document with all of this data.***
