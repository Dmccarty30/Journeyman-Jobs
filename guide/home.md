# Home Screen corrections

`This is a comprehensive walkthrough of the home screen`

* Aftter it says welcome back, users **first and last name**
* Add a circle container for an image or avatar.
* remove 'Ready to find your next opportunity?'

## Quick Actions

* each of these quick action tile need to have a navigation action attatched to them. for the time being remove only the text and icons and replace with placeholders for 'code updates', 'safety checkin', 'report hazard', and 'ppe suppliers'.
* i would love to have the ability inside my app to help journeyman around the country get out of a bind because they would have electrical calc in their pockets. Not only that but also access to troubleshooting guides and wiring diagrams and electrical laws and safe practices... So that text and icon stays
* hy is the next tile a different size, color, and shape? change it to match the rest

### Electrical industry stats

***REMOVE***

### Suggested Jobs

* This is where the user will see all of the jobs that most meet or match their criteria set during onboarding. For example, whatever the user sets for their classification is **ALWAYS** the primary sort and filter value. **ALWAYS**. If the user is an operator they have no business seeing job calls for inside wiremen. then is is construction type, hours, per diem, then everything after that holds no significance.
* So the 'Suggested Jobs' will be a list view with a backend call to the jobs collection
* The cards are going to be much smaller than the normal sized cards for the job screen. here the only need to display the local number, classification,location and hours.
* when the user clicks on the button on the left side of the card, then the dialog box contain all of the data will appear.

 **The Advanced Sorting and Filtering Algorithm**

 I have absolutely how to make this a reality so you have free range. Use the tools that best fit the task at hand.. MCP servers are a game changer, use them. This feature is non-negotiable it is the engine that customizes the app to the users wants and needs.
