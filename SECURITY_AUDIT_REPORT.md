# Journeyman Jobs Crews Feature - Security Audit Report

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Auditor**: Security Architect Agent
**Scope**: Crews Feature Security Infrastructure
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL

## Executive Summary

The Journeyman Jobs Crews Feature is currently operating in **DEVELOPMENT MODE** with **CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** that must be addressed before production deployment. The current Firebase security rules allow any authenticated user full access to all crew data, creating significant data security and privacy risks.

## Critical Security Findings

### üö® CRITICAL: Development Mode Security Rules
**File**: `firebase/firestore.rules`
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: Any authenticated user can access, modify, or delete any crew data

**Current State**:
```javascript
match /crews/{crewId} {
  allow read, write: if isAuthenticated(); // CRITICAL VULNERABILITY
}
```

**Issues Identified**:
- No crew membership verification
- No role-based access control
- No data validation or sanitization
- Cross-crew data exposure possible

### üö® CRITICAL: Disabled Permission System
**File**: `lib/features/crews/services/crew_service.dart`
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL
**Impact**: All permission checks bypassed, unauthorized access possible

**Current State**:
```dart
// DEV MODE: Permission check bypassed for development testing
// TODO: Re-enable permission check before production deployment
```

**Issues Identified**:
- `hasPermission()` function always returns `true`
- Role-based access control disabled
- Foreman verification bypassed
- Member validation disabled

### üö® HIGH: Missing Rate Limiting
**Files**: Service files throughout codebase
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Impact**: API abuse, spam, DoS attacks possible

**Issues Identified**:
- No rate limiting on crew creation
- No invitation rate limits
- No message posting limits
- No API abuse protection

### üö® MEDIUM: Insufficient Input Validation
**Files**: Multiple service and validation files
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: Data injection, malformed data possible

**Issues Identified**:
- Basic validation only
- No comprehensive input sanitization
- Limited field validation
- Missing data integrity checks

## Security Architecture Analysis
