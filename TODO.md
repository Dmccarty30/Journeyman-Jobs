## STORM SCREEN

## CREWS SCREEN

- When you create a new crew, once you hit the `create crew` button, this needs to create a new document in the 'crews' collection. The documents UID will be the name the user input+a numerical counter to keep track of how many crews have been created+timestamp so to keep track of how long and when the crew was created.
- When create a crew Navigate back to the original creator crew or join a crew screen but whenever I navigate elsewhere in the app and then come back to the create crews screen, It's like the screen flickers back and forth between the creator crew and what I think is the tail board screen i'm not sure but another screen so it makes me think that conditional formatting or conditional builder is involved. So I need for you to investigate why this is and how to correct it
