● The error means that the /auth_eval command tried to execute eza . --tree (a modern file tree listing command), but eza is not installed on your Windows system.

  eza is a modern replacement for the ls command with tree view capabilities. On Windows, you can either:

  1. Use the built-in tree command instead:
  tree /F
  2. Install eza if you want to use it:
    - Via Scoop: scoop install eza
    - Via Cargo: cargo install eza
    - Via Chocolatey: choco install eza
  3. Use PowerShell's tree alternative:
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Format-Table -AutoSize

  The /auth_eval command appears to be trying to show your project structure as part of analyzing the authentication system. Since you're on Windows, the command needs to be adjusted
  to use Windows-compatible tools.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to follow the instructions in the /create-tasks command file and generate a comprehensive list of tasks based on analyzing the Journeyman Jobs codebase. The 
  command indicates I should:

  1. Run parallel analysis using auth-expert, backend-architect, and database-optimizer agents
  2. Have codebase-coordinator synthesize the findings
  3. Have task-expert convert the report into executable tasks
  4. Structure tasks in groups/phases with proper dependencies
  5. Label difficulty and assign appropriate agents

  Since I'm in plan mode, I need to:
  1. Analyze the current codebase state using the information I've gathered
  2. Generate comprehensive task lists organized by phases
  3. Assign difficulty levels and appropriate agents
  4. Ensure proper task ordering based on dependencies
  5. Present this as a comprehensive plan

  Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can identify several key areas that need attention:

  1. Authentication system improvements
  2. Backend architecture optimization
  3. Database/Firestore optimization
  4. Testing coverage improvements
  5. Performance optimizations
  6. Code cleanup and refactoring
  7. Feature enhancements

  Let me create a detailed task list following the ultrathink approach with comprehensive analysis.

● I'll analyze the Journeyman Jobs codebase comprehensively and generate a detailed task list organized by phases, with proper dependencies, difficulty ratings, and agent assignments.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze authentication system for improvements       
     ☐ Review backend architecture and API patterns
     ☐ Examine Firestore/database optimization opportunities
     ☐ Identify testing gaps and coverage needs
     ☐ Assess performance bottlenecks
     ☐ Generate comprehensive task list with phases

✻ Thinking…

  Let me analyze the codebase more deeply to create a comprehensive task list. I should examine key areas like authentication, services, models, and UI components to identify specific
   improvements needed.

  I'll look at various parts of the codebase to understand what needs to be done.

● Let me examine key areas of the codebase to generate a comprehensive task list:

● Search(pattern: "TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK", glob: "**/*.dart", output_mode: "content", head_limit: 20)
  ⎿  Found 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good, I found some TODOs in the codebase. Let me also check for test coverage and examine the authentication system more closely.

● Search(pattern: "test\(|testWidgets\(", glob: "test/**/*.dart", output_mode: "count", head_limit: 50)
  ⎿  Found 614 matches across 44 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Good, the project has decent test coverage with 614 test cases across 44 files. Let me check the auth service and look for more architectural patterns.

● Read(lib\services\auth_service.dart)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me check the Firestore service configuration to understand the database architecture better.

  Let me check for crew services to understand collaborative features, and then compile all findings into a comprehensive task list with proper phases, dependencies, and agent 
  assignments.

● Read(lib\features\crews\services\crew_service.dart)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have enough information to create a comprehensive task list. Based on my analysis, I've found:
  
  1. TODOs in the codebase that need implementation
  2. Authentication system that could be enhanced
  3. Backend services that need optimization
  4. Firestore/database patterns that could be improved
  5. Testing coverage that's good (614 tests) but could be expanded
  6. Crew features with permission system that works but could be enhanced
  7. Performance areas that need attention
  
  Let me now generate a comprehensive task list organized by phases with proper dependencies, difficulty ratings, and agent assignments.

● Based on my comprehensive analysis of the Journeyman Jobs codebase, I'll now generate a detailed task list organized in phases with proper dependencies, difficulty ratings, and

✻ Thinking…

  The user has approved the plan! Now I should start implementing the tasks. Since many tasks can be executed in parallel (marked with [P]), I should begin with Phase 1 critical 
  fixes. Let me start by updating my todo list with the Phase 1 tasks.

● Great! The comprehensive task plan has been approved. Let me update the todo list with Phase 1 critical tasks to begin implementation:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Fix Google Sign-In API Compatibility in auth_service.dart
     ☐ Implement Missing Security Rules for Firestore
     ☐ Fix Crew Cloud Function Trigger
     ☐ Create Composite Indexes for Firestore
     ☐ Optimize Large Collection Queries (797+ union locals)
     ☐ Implement Offline Data Sync with conflict resolution
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Change of plans. Save that plan in the root directory. I need for you to take that exact approach and apply it to the issues and concerns that i have documented in my @TODO.md file.
   "Just as before, generate a detailed and comprehensive tasks list with same amount of scrutiny outputting the same criteria per task. Meaning the apprpriate agent, degree of 
  difficulty, etc. Once you have generated the plan, we will begin working on this assignment first. Do you understand what I am asking you to do?"
  ⎿  Read TODO.md (225 lines)

● Yes, I understand exactly what you're asking. I'll:
  1. First save the previous comprehensive task plan to the root directory
  2. Then analyze your TODO.md file with the same level of scrutiny
  3. Generate a new detailed task list specifically for your TODO items with agents, difficulty levels, dependencies, etc.

  Let me start by saving the previous plan:

● Write(COMPREHENSIVE_TASK_PLAN.md)
  ⎿  Wrote 1 lines to COMPREHENSIVE_TASK_PLAN.md

  implementation!

> Perfect the tasks are phenominal. Only one thing, i need for you to add a ckeckbox for each task so that when a task is completed the agent can check it off to show the status of 
  each task, it is easier to pick up where we left off, and it is just a good practice, especially when dealing with such a large and complex list where multiple agent will be 
  interacting with the list. So, make this modification and I will have new instructions for you once completed

● Perfect! I'll add checkboxes to each task in the TODO Implementation Plan to make it easy to track progress and for multiple agents to interact with the list.

● Update(TODO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
