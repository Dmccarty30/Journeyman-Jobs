# SCRATCHPAD

## AUTH SCREEN

- look at the image @assets\images\auth-screen-tab-bar.png. This i A screenshot of the tab bar on the auth screen. There is a gap at the bottom of the two tabs and boarder. This is unacceptable. also, the design and layout is subpar. I need for to content, functions, actions, data bindings, navigations, authentications, etc. to remain the same. However i would like to completely make over the UI. While respecting the app theme. Remove the electric curcuit background and replace it with another animated or reactive background.
