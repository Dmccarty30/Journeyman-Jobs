		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Flutter Project with Firebase Integration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Flutter project setup and Firebase integration into subtasks covering: 1) Initial Flutter project creation and dependency configuration, 2) Firebase project setup and platform-specific configuration, 3) Firebase initialization and core services setup, and 4) Firebase security rules configuration and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple steps across different platforms (iOS/Android) and requires careful configuration of Firebase services. While the instructions are detailed, there are several distinct phases that would benefit from separation: project creation, Firebase console setup, code integration, and security configuration. Each phase has its own potential issues and testing requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Models and Repository Pattern",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the data models and repository pattern implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core data model classes with serialization, 2) Repository interfaces definition, 3) Firebase repository implementations, 4) Repository provider for dependency injection, and 5) Unit tests for models and repositories.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating multiple complex data models with serialization logic, designing a repository pattern architecture, implementing Firebase-specific repository classes, and setting up dependency injection. The code is substantial and would benefit from being broken into logical components that can be developed and tested independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the authentication system implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Email/password authentication, 2) Google Sign-In integration, 3) Apple Sign-In integration, 4) AuthService and AuthProvider implementation, 5) Authentication state management and routing, and 6) Authentication UI screens.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is complex due to multiple sign-in methods (email/password, Google, Apple) that each have their own implementation details and platform-specific considerations. The task also involves state management, routing logic, and UI components. Each authentication method should be implemented and tested separately to ensure reliability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Navigation and UI Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the core navigation and UI structure implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Theme configuration and styling system, 2) Bottom navigation bar and main screen structure, 3) Splash screen and initial routing logic, 4) Onboarding flow implementation, and 5) Reusable UI components library.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating the foundational UI architecture of the app, including theming, navigation, and core screens. It requires careful planning to ensure consistency and maintainability. Breaking it into components like theming, navigation structure, initial screens, and reusable components will make the implementation more manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Job Listings and Filtering",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the job listings and filtering implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Basic job listing screen with Firestore integration, 2) Job card UI component, 3) Job details screen, 4) Filter dialog with multiple filter options, 5) Search functionality, 6) Real-time data updates handling, and 7) Performance optimization for large datasets.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex feature with multiple UI components, real-time data handling, and advanced filtering capabilities. The implementation includes stream-based data fetching, complex UI rendering, filter logic, and detailed screens. Performance considerations for large datasets add another layer of complexity that requires careful implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Profile and Preferences",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the user profile and preferences implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Profile data model and repository methods, 2) Profile viewing UI with tabbed interface, 3) Profile setup wizard for new users, 4) Profile editing functionality, 5) Preferences management, and 6) Profile image handling and storage.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex user profile system with multiple tabs, forms for data entry, and state management. The profile setup wizard and editing functionality require careful form validation and data handling. Profile image management adds another layer of complexity with storage considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Local Union Directory",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the local union directory implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Locals listing screen with search and filtering, 2) Local card UI component, 3) Local details screen with comprehensive information, 4) Contact actions (phone, email, website), and 5) State filtering and search functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This feature involves creating a directory with filtering, search, and detailed information display. While similar to the job listings in structure, it has unique requirements for displaying union-specific information and contact actions. The UI components and data handling need careful implementation to ensure usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI-Powered Features",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI-powered features implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Google Generative AI integration for job matching, 2) Firebase Functions setup for API proxying, 3) OpenAI integration for career recommendations, 4) Anthropic Claude integration for wage analysis, 5) AI recommendations screen with tabbed interface, 6) Job recommendations UI, 7) Career path recommendations UI, and 8) Wage trend analysis visualization.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks in the project, involving multiple AI services (Google Generative AI, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude) and requiring both client and server-side implementation. Each AI integration has its own complexity, and the UI needs to present the AI-generated insights in a user-friendly way. Security considerations for API keys add another layer of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Offline Capability and Data Synchronization",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the offline capability and data synchronization implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Firestore offline persistence configuration, 2) Network connectivity monitoring service, 3) Local data caching system, 4) Repository adaptations for offline support, 5) Data synchronization service, 6) Offline UI indicators and user experience, and 7) Conflict resolution strategy.",
			"reasoning": "Offline support is inherently complex, requiring careful management of local data caching, network state monitoring, and synchronization logic. The implementation needs to handle various edge cases like conflict resolution and partial connectivity. The architecture must ensure data integrity while providing a seamless user experience in both online and offline modes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Analytics, Error Reporting, and Performance Monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the analytics, error reporting, and performance monitoring implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Firebase Analytics integration and custom event tracking, 2) Crashlytics setup and error reporting service, 3) Performance monitoring for critical operations, 4) Global error handling and UI, and 5) Service provider for dependency injection.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves integrating multiple Firebase services (Analytics, Crashlytics, Performance) and creating a comprehensive monitoring system. While the individual integrations are straightforward, creating a cohesive system that properly tracks events, reports errors, and monitors performance requires careful implementation. The global error handling and service provider architecture add architectural complexity."
